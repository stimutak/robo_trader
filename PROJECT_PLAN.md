## Robo Trader â€” Intelligent Trading Bot Project Plan

This plan focuses on building an **intelligent autonomous trading bot** that uses AI/LLMs to understand market events and make profitable trades. Intelligence over speed.

### Mission
Create a profitable trading system that:
- Uses LLMs to analyze market events like a master trader
- Reacts to news, earnings, and economic data before retail traders
- Adapts strategies based on market conditions
- Generates 2-5% monthly returns with <15% max drawdown

### Architecture: Intelligence-First Design
