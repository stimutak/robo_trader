## Critical Issues from GPT5 Review

### Issues Being Addressed:
1. **Config System**: Upgrading from dataclass to Pydantic with validation (Phase 1)
2. **IBKR Client**: Converting to fully async with retry/backoff (Phase 1)
3. **Execution**: Building state machine with realistic fills (Phase 3)
4. **Risk Management**: Adding ATR/Kelly sizing, correlation controls, kill-switches (Phase 4)
5. **Strategy**: Implementing ML features and regime filters (Phase 2-3)
6. **Runner**: Parallel processing, async SQLite operations (Phase 1)
7. **Inconsistency**: Integrating aspirational modules with main runner (Phase 2)

### Quick Wins Timeline (Week 1-4):
- Make all IBKR calls non-blocking and retryable
- Parallelize per-symbol processing with asyncio.gather
- Replace dataclass config with Pydantic BaseSettings
- Implement daily loss/drawdown counters
- Fix strategy guards and add liquidity filters

## Implementation Notes

This plan addresses the critical issues identified in the GPT5 review while building toward ML-driven profitability. The phased approach ensures:

1. **Quick Wins First**: Infrastructure fixes provide immediate performance improvements
2. **Foundation Before Features**: Solid async architecture before advanced ML
3. **Risk-First Approach**: Comprehensive risk management before live trading
4. **Measurable Progress**: Clear success criteria for each milestone

The plan leverages existing code where possible (walk-forward optimization, correlation analysis) while systematically replacing weak points with production-grade implementations.
