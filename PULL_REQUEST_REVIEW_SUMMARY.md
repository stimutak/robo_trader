## 📊 **Performance Improvements**

### OBV Calculation Optimization
| Dataset Size | Vectorized Time | Iterative Time | Speedup |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| 1,000 rows  | 0.30ms         | 21.07ms        | **69.7x** |
| 5,000 rows  | 0.34ms         | 104.33ms       | **303.3x** |
| 10,000 rows | 0.40ms         | 207.25ms       | **517.8x** |

### Before vs After Code
**Before (Iterative O(n)):**
```python
for i in range(1, len(df)):
    if df['close'].iloc[i] > df['close'].iloc[i-1]:
        obv.iloc[i] = obv.iloc[i-1] + df['volume'].iloc[i]
    elif df['close'].iloc[i] < df['close'].iloc[i-1]:
        obv.iloc[i] = obv.iloc[i-1] - df['volume'].iloc[i]
    else:
        obv.iloc[i] = obv.iloc[i-1]
```

**After (Vectorized O(1)):**
```python
# Calculate price changes
price_changes = df["close"].diff()

volume_direction = pd.Series(0, index=df.index, dtype=int)
volume_direction[price_changes > 0] = 1
volume_direction[price_changes < 0] = -1

# Calculate OBV as cumulative sum of directed volume
directed_volume = df["volume"] * volume_direction
directed_volume.iloc[0] = df["volume"].iloc[0]

obv = directed_volume.cumsum()
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### Correctness Validation
