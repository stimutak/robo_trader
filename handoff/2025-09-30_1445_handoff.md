## Session Summary
**CRITICAL FIX:** Identified and resolved root cause of TWS zombie connection issue that has plagued the system since Sept 23.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Since Sept 23 (commit 285a85c), the system has required frequent TWS restarts due to zombie connections in `CLOSE_WAIT` state. After 5 failed connection attempts, TWS would be completely blocked.

### Why Zombies Didn't Exist Before Sept 23
- **Early development (pre-Sept 23)**: Simple connection code without retry logic, connections either worked or failed cleanly
- **Sept 23 onwards**: Added robust connection retry logic (5 retries with exponential backoff) but **failed to clean up failed IB() objects**

### The Bug (robo_trader/utils/robust_connection.py:391-408)
```python
async def _connect():
    """Internal connection function."""
    ib = IB()
    await ib.connectAsync(...)  # Creates TCP socket

    # If timeout or error occurs here, ib object is abandoned
    # TCP socket left in CLOSE_WAIT state = ZOMBIE!

    accounts = ib.managedAccounts()
    if not accounts:
        raise ConnectionError("No managed accounts")  # Zombie created!

    return ib
```

**Impact**: Each failed retry created a zombie connection. After 5 failures, TWS had 5 zombie sockets and refused new connections.

## The Fix (Commit 5c791fa)

Added proper cleanup in try/except block:

```python
async def _connect():
    """Internal connection function."""
    ib = IB()
    try:
        await ib.connectAsync(...)
        # ... verification logic ...
        return ib
    except Exception as e:
        # CRITICAL: Clean up failed connection to prevent zombie sockets
        try:
            if ib.isConnected():
                ib.disconnect()
        except Exception as cleanup_err:
            logger.warning(f"Error disconnecting failed IB connection: {cleanup_err}")
        raise
```

**Result**: Failed connections are now properly cleaned up, preventing zombie socket accumulation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Zombie Connection Leak
**File:** `robo_trader/utils/robust_connection.py` (lines 394-417)
- Wrapped `_connect()` in try/except
- Call `ib.disconnect()` on any failure before re-raising exception
- Prevents zombie TCP sockets from accumulating

**Commit:** `5c791fa` - "CRITICAL: Fix TWS zombie connection leak in robust_connection"

## Current System Status

### ⚠️ Testing Required
System is currently NOT running due to existing zombie connections from previous failures.

**To Test the Fix:**
1. **Restart TWS** to clear existing zombie connections
2. Start system:
```bash
# Kill all processes
pkill -9 -f "runner_async" && pkill -9 -f "app.py" && pkill -9 -f "websocket_server"

# Start system
cd /Users/oliver/robo_trader
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start WebSocket server
python3 -m robo_trader.websocket_server &

# Start trading runner
export LOG_FILE=/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader.log
python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF,QQQ,QLD,BBIO,IMRX,CRGY &

# Start dashboard
export DASH_PORT=5555
python3 app.py &
```

3. **Verify** no zombie connections accumulate:
```bash
# Check for CLOSE_WAIT connections
netstat -an | grep 7497 | grep CLOSE_WAIT

# Should see NO CLOSE_WAIT connections even if connection fails/retries
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Connection retries should NOT leave zombie sockets
- ✅ Circuit breaker will still open after 5 failures (300s timeout)
- ✅ TWS will NOT be blocked by accumulated zombies
- ✅ System can retry indefinitely without requiring TWS restart

## Technical Details

### Why This Bug Was Hard to Find
1. **Symptoms looked like TWS issue** - "TWS needs restart" masked the real problem
2. **Worked in early dev** - No retry logic meant no zombies
3. **Sept 23 commit seemed like a fix** - Actually introduced the bug
4. **Logs showed timeouts** - But didn't show abandoned IB() objects

### Connection Flow (Before Fix)
```
Attempt 1: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → IB() abandoned (ZOMBIE 1)
Attempt 2: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → IB() abandoned (ZOMBIE 2)
Attempt 3: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → IB() abandoned (ZOMBIE 3)
Attempt 4: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → IB() abandoned (ZOMBIE 4)
Attempt 5: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → IB() abandoned (ZOMBIE 5)
Result: 5 zombies in CLOSE_WAIT, TWS blocked
```

### Connection Flow (After Fix)
```
Attempt 1: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → ib.disconnect() → No zombie
Attempt 2: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → ib.disconnect() → No zombie
Attempt 3: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → ib.disconnect() → No zombie
Attempt 4: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → ib.disconnect() → No zombie
Attempt 5: Create IB() → connectAsync() → Timeout → Exception → ib.disconnect() → No zombie
Result: No zombies, TWS still functional, circuit breaker opens
```

## Files Changed
- `robo_trader/utils/robust_connection.py` - Add cleanup for failed connections

## Next Steps
1. **User must restart TWS** to clear existing zombie connections
2. Test system with the fix
3. Monitor for zombie connections during retry scenarios
4. Verify circuit breaker still functions correctly
5. Update CLAUDE.md if needed

## Session Notes
- Investigated why zombies only appeared after Sept 23
- Found commit 285a85c added retry logic without cleanup
- Identified exact line where IB() objects were abandoned
- Implemented proper cleanup in try/except block
- Committed fix with comprehensive explanation

## Session End
**Status**: Fix committed, ready for testing after TWS restart
**Branch**: main
**Latest Commit**: 5c791fa

This fix resolves the chronic zombie connection issue without requiring TWS restarts between failures.
