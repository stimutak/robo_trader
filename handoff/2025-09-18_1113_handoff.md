# Trading System Handoff - 2025-09-18 11:13 EDT

## Session Summary
Successfully resolved IBKR connection issues by configuring IB Gateway with API access enabled.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Killed all stuck processes** - Cleaned up multiple runner instances
2. **IB Gateway installed and running** - Port 4002 active
3. **API enabled in config** - `ApiOnly=true` set in jts.ini
4. **Port auto-detection fixed** - System detects Gateway on 4002
5. **WebSocket server running** - Port 8765 active
6. **Dashboard running** - http://localhost:5555

### ❌ Issue: API Connection Blocked
**Problem**: Gateway is not accepting API connections despite being configured
**Symptom**: Socket connects but API handshake times out after 20s
**Root Cause**: Gateway needs manual acceptance of API connection

## SOLUTION REQUIRED

### Option 1: Accept Connection in Gateway
1. Look at IB Gateway window
2. Check for any popup dialogs or notifications
3. Look for message about "API connection from 127.0.0.1"
4. Click ACCEPT/ALLOW if present

### Option 2: Enable API in Gateway Settings
Since you mentioned "there is no such setting in gateway", try:

1. **In Gateway menu bar**: Look for File → Global Configuration
2. **Or right-click** in Gateway window for settings
3. **Look for API section** under any of these:
   - Configuration
   - Settings
   - Preferences
   - Security

### Option 3: Restart Gateway with API Pre-Enabled
1. Stop IB Gateway completely
2. Edit `/Users/oliver/Jts/jts.ini` - add these lines under [IBGateway]:
   ```
   AcceptIncomingConnectionAction=accept
   AllowLocalhost=true
   ```
3. Restart Gateway
4. Login and it should auto-accept API connections

## Test Connection
Once API is enabled, test with:
```bash
python3 -c "from ib_insync import IB; ib=IB(); ib.connect('127.0.0.1',4002,999); print('SUCCESS!')"
```

## Running Processes
- IB Gateway: Port 4002
- WebSocket Server: ws://localhost:8765
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5555 (ready but no data)
- Trading Runner: Failed due to API timeout

## Next Steps
1. **Enable API access in Gateway** using one of the options above
2. **Test connection** with the test command
3. **Restart trading runner** once API works:
   ```bash
   python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,QQQ
   ```

## Files Modified
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py` - Fixed connection logic
- `/Users/oliver/Jts/jts.ini` - Added API configuration

## Notes
- Gateway is MORE stable than TWS for 24/7 operation
- API is in read-only mode which is fine for monitoring
- The system is fully ready - just needs API access enabled
