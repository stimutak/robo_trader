**Date:** 2025-08-26 20:08 PST
**Session:** Fixed Trading System Issues & Added Watchlist Feature

## Current Status

### âœ… Running Processes
- **Dashboard:** Running on port 5555 (http://localhost:5555)
  - PID: Check with `lsof -i :5555`
  - Watchlist tab showing all 19 symbols with real-time prices
  - Connected to real SQLite database
  
### ðŸ”„ System State
- **Database:** SQLite database with clean data
  - 0 positions (synced with actual IB account)
  - 19 symbols in watchlist from user_settings.json
  - 7,000+ market data records being collected
  - Connection pool: 5 async connections

- **User Symbols in Watchlist:**
  - AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, IXHL, NUAI, BZAI, ELTP, OPEN, CEG
  - VRT, PLTR, UPST, TEM, HTFL, SDGR, APLD, SOFI, CORZ, WULF

## Issues Fixed This Session

### 1. âœ… Timestamp Database Error - FIXED
**Problem:** "Error binding parameter 2: type 'Timestamp' is not supported"
**Solution:** Convert pandas Timestamp to datetime before database insertion
```python
# In runner_async.py line 183-184
if hasattr(timestamp, 'to_pydatetime'):
    timestamp = timestamp.to_pydatetime()
```
**Result:** Trading system can now continuously fetch and store market data

### 2. âœ… Position Sync Issue - FIXED  
**Problem:** Database showed fake test positions that didn't exist in IB account
**Solution:** 
- Created sync_ib_positions.py script
- Fixed AsyncIBKRClient to use correct IB API method (reqPositionsAsync)
- Cleared all test data and synced with real IB account (0 positions)
**Result:** Database now accurately reflects actual IB account state

### 3. âœ… Watchlist Feature - ADDED
**Problem:** User wanted to watch stocks without owning them
**Solution:**
- Created watchlist table in database
- Added /api/watchlist endpoint 
- Added Watchlist tab to dashboard UI
- Populated with all 19 user symbols
**Result:** Can now monitor any stocks without needing positions

## Next Steps

### 1. ðŸŸ¡ Important - Complete Real-Time Data Flow
- Wire up WebSocket connections for live price updates
- Remove polling in favor of push updates
- Connect strategy signals to dashboard

### 2. ðŸŸ¢ Enhancement - Add Trading Controls
- Add buy/sell buttons in dashboard
- Implement position size calculator
- Add stop-loss/take-profit controls

### 3. ðŸŸ¢ Enhancement - Improve Watchlist
- Add ability to add/remove symbols from UI
- Add notes/alerts per symbol
- Show daily change percentages

## Session Summary

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Fixed Critical Timestamp Error**
   - Trading system can now run continuously
   - Market data properly stored in database
   - Tested with multiple symbols successfully

2. **Cleaned Up Database**
   - Removed all fake test positions
   - Synced with real IB account (showing 0 positions correctly)
   - Created utility script for future syncs

3. **Added Watchlist Feature**
   - All 19 user symbols now tracked
   - Shows real-time prices from market data
   - Distinguishes between watched symbols and actual positions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. Convert pandas Timestamps to Python datetime for SQLite compatibility
2. Use separate watchlist table instead of overloading positions table
3. Show watchlist as primary tab since user has no positions

## Quick Commands

### Check Running Services
```bash
lsof -i :5555  # Dashboard
lsof -i :7497  # IB TWS
ps aux | grep python | grep -E "(app.py|runner_async)"
```

### Restart Dashboard
```bash
kill $(lsof -t -i:5555)
cd /Users/oliver/robo_trader

```

### Sync IB Positions
```bash
python sync_ib_positions.py
```

### View Watchlist Data
```bash
sqlite3 trading_data.db "SELECT * FROM watchlist ORDER BY symbol;"
```

### View Market Data Collection
```bash
sqlite3 trading_data.db "SELECT symbol, COUNT(*), MAX(timestamp) FROM market_data GROUP BY symbol;"
