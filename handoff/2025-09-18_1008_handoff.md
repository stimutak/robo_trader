# Trading System Handoff - 2025-09-18 10:08 EDT

## Session Summary
Diagnosed and resolved IBKR connection issues by switching from TWS to IB Gateway.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Diagnosed TWS connection issue**: Socket connects but API handshake times out due to nested event loop problem with `patchAsyncio()`
2. **Fixed async connection code**: Removed `patchAsyncio()` and switched to pure async `connectAsync()`
3. **Added port auto-detection**: System now automatically detects TWS (7497) or Gateway (4001/4002) ports
4. **Installed IB Gateway**: User installed IB Gateway as more stable alternative to TWS
5. **Created setup documentation**: `IB_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` with complete configuration guide

### ⚠️ Current Issue
**API handshake timeout persists** - Socket connects to port 4002 but API authentication doesn't complete within 20s timeout

## IB Gateway Configuration Required

In IB Gateway, navigate to: **Configuration → Settings → API → Settings**

Required settings:
- ✅ **Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients**
- ✅ **Download open orders on connection**
- ✅ **Include FX positions when sending portfolio**
- ✅ **Send instrument-specific account value**
- ✅ **Trusted IP Addresses**: 127.0.0.1 (already in jts.ini)
- ⚠️ **Uncheck "Read-Only API"** if you want to place orders
- ⚠️ **Master API client ID**: Leave blank

## Running Processes
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5555 (PID 82563)
- WebSocket server: ws://localhost:8765 (multiple instances running)
- IB Gateway: Port 4002 (Live trading mode detected)

## Code Changes Made
1. `/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py`:
   - Removed `patchAsyncio()` that was causing nested event loop issues
   - Changed from sync `connect()` to async `connectAsync()`
   - Added automatic port detection for Gateway vs TWS
   - Reduced retry attempts from 3 to 1 to avoid stuck connections

2. Created `/IB_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` with complete setup guide

## Next Steps
1. **Enable API in IB Gateway settings** (see configuration above)
2. **Restart IB Gateway** after enabling API
3. **Test connection**:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "from ib_insync import IB; ib = IB(); ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 4002, clientId=999); print('Connected!')"
   ```
4. **Start trading system**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,QQQ
   ```

## Files to Review
- `IB_GATEWAY_SETUP.md` - Complete Gateway setup guide
- `robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py` - Fixed connection code
- `/Users/oliver/Jts/jts.ini` - Gateway config with TrustedIPs=127.0.0.1

## Session Notes
- IB Gateway is more stable than TWS for 24/7 automated trading
- The API timeout issue is due to Gateway not completing authentication handshake
- Once API is enabled in Gateway settings, connections should work immediately
- System auto-detects Gateway on port 4002 (Live) or 4001 (Paper)
