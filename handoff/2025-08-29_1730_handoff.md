- Smart execution: Implemented, ready for integration

## Commands

### ML Strategy Usage
```bash
# Run with ML strategy
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA --use-ml

# Retrain models (takes ~3 seconds)
python train_models_timeseries.py
```

### Smart Execution Usage (after integration)
```python
from robo_trader.execution.smart_executor import SmartExecutor, ExecutionParams, ExecutionAlgorithm

executor = SmartExecutor(config)
plan = await executor.create_execution_plan(
    symbol="AAPL",
    side="BUY",
    quantity=10000,
    params=ExecutionParams(
        algorithm=ExecutionAlgorithm.VWAP,
        duration_minutes=30
    )
)
result = await executor.execute_plan(plan, paper_executor)
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3 S3-S5)
1. **S3: Multi-Strategy Portfolio Manager** (36h)
   - Dynamic capital allocation across strategies
   - Risk budgeting and correlation-aware diversification

2. **S4: Microstructure Strategies** (28h)
   - High-frequency strategies using order book dynamics
   - Sub-second execution capabilities

3. **S5: Mean Reversion Strategy Suite** (24h)
   - Statistical arbitrage and pairs trading
   - ML-enhanced entry/exit timing

## Performance Metrics

### ML Models
- Random Forest: 52.97% accuracy (85% train, indicating overfitting)
- XGBoost: 52.69% accuracy (97% train, severe overfitting)
- LightGBM: 54.48% accuracy (93% train, overfitting)

### Recommendations for Model Improvement
1. Use 5-10 years of data instead of 2
2. Add 20-50 more symbols for training
3. Include fundamental and sentiment features
4. Implement proper hyperparameter tuning
5. Consider predicting larger moves (>1%) instead of any direction

## Known Issues
1. ML models don't meet 60% accuracy threshold (system uses fallback)
2. No short selling implemented (only sells owned positions)
3. Smart execution not yet integrated into main trading loop
4. Model overfitting needs to be addressed

## Session Notes
- User emphasized fixing issues rather than workarounds
- Successfully implemented two major components of Phase 3
- Smart execution algorithms ready but need integration
- ML strategy working despite low model accuracy

## Session Duration
~2.5 hours (15:00 - 17:30)

## Outstanding Tasks (15 items)

### Smart Execution Integration (7 tasks)
1. **Integrate Smart Execution into PaperExecutor** - Modify executor to use smart algorithms
2. **Update runner_async.py to initialize SmartExecutor** - Add to setup method
3. **Add execution algorithm selection based on order size** - Auto-select TWAP/VWAP/Iceberg
4. **Add execution parameters to config** - Algorithm defaults, thresholds, participation rates
5. **Connect real market data for volume profiles** - Replace mock data with real liquidity metrics
6. **Add execution monitoring to dashboard** - Show active plans, slippage, impact stats
7. **Test smart execution with different order sizes** - Validate algorithms work correctly

### ML Model Improvements (8 tasks)
8. **Improve ML model accuracy to >60%** - Currently at 53%, need better performance
9. **Fetch 5 years of historical data** - More data for better pattern recognition
10. **Add 30 more symbols to training dataset** - Increase diversity of examples
11. **Implement hyperparameter tuning** - Use GridSearchCV for optimal parameters
12. **Change target to predict >1% moves only** - Easier than predicting any direction
13. **Add regularization to prevent overfitting** - Reduce train/test gap (85% vs 53%)
14. **Implement short selling capability** - Allow negative positions for full trading
15. **Add fundamental features** - P/E ratios, volume patterns, market cap data

### Quick Wins (can be done in <1 hour)
- Change prediction target to >1% moves (15 mins)
- Add regularization parameters (20 mins)
- Increase training data to 5 years (30 mins)
- Add more symbols to dataset (30 mins)

### Solutions for Key Issues

**Model Accuracy Fix:**
```python
# Change from predicting any direction
df['target'] = np.where(df['returns'].shift(-1) > 0.01, 1,  # >1% up
                np.where(df['returns'].shift(-1) < -0.01, -1,  # >1% down
                0))  # No significant move
```

**Overfitting Fix:**
```python
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    max_depth=5,  # Reduced from 10
    min_samples_split=50,  # Increased from 20
    min_samples_leaf=25,  # Increased from 10
    max_features='sqrt'  # Limit features
)
```

**Short Selling Implementation:**
```python
# In risk manager
if signal == -1 and position == 0:
    position = -quantity  # Short sell
elif signal == 1 and position < 0:
    position = 0  # Cover short
```
