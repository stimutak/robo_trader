## Project Status
**Branch**: main  
**Last Commit**: aa01822 - Merge pull request #1 from stimutak/add-claude-github-actions  
**Project Phase**: Phase 1-4 Complete (Foundation through Reliability)

## System Overview
Robo Trader is an intelligent autonomous trading bot focused on **intelligence over speed**. The system is designed to:
- Use LLMs for market event understanding
- React to news and earnings before retail traders
- Implement adaptive strategies based on market conditions
- Target 2-5% monthly returns with strict risk management

## Recent Progress
### Completed Features
✅ **Foundation (Phase 0)**
- Repository scaffold with test structure
- Paper-only runner with basic SMA strategy
- Risk guardrails and configuration system

✅ **Data & Integration (Phase 1)**
- IBKRClient integration with ib_insync
- Historical bar normalization
- Unit tests for data handling

✅ **Portfolio Tracking (Phase 2)**
- In-memory portfolio with PnL tracking
- Position management system
- Portfolio tests passing

✅ **Risk Management (Phase 3)**
- Per-order and per-day notional caps
- Slippage toggle in PaperExecutor
- Comprehensive risk boundary tests

✅ **Reliability (Phase 4)**
- Retry/backoff mechanism for connections
- Central logging system
- Enhanced CLI with configurable parameters

### GitHub Actions Added
- Claude Code Review workflow
- Claude PR Assistant workflow

## Current Architecture

## Running Processes
**None currently active** - System is not running

### To Start Trading System:
```bash
# Preferred method (starts dashboard + AI trading)
./restart_trading.sh

# Alternative manual startup
python app.py &  # Dashboard at http://localhost:5555
python start_ai_trading.py  # AI trading with 21 symbols

# Legacy direct runner
python -m robo_trader.runner --symbols SPY,QQQ,TSLA
```

## Configuration Status
- **Mode**: Paper trading (default)
- **Required ENV**: IBKR_HOST, IBKR_PORT, IBKR_CLIENT_ID
- **Optional**: OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (for future LLM integration)

## Test Suite Status
- Tests not currently running (environment not activated)
- Test coverage includes: risk, strategies, portfolio, retry, IBKRClient

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Phase 5 - In Progress)
1. **Multi-Strategy Framework**
   - Implement StrategyManager for combining strategies
   - Add correlation guard for overlapping exposures
   - Create asyncio event system

### Short-term (This Week)
2. **Intelligence Layer (Phase 6)**
   - Integrate LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic) for market analysis
   - Build news ingestion pipeline
   - Implement event-driven trading framework

3. **Real-time Streaming (Phase 7)**
   - Add real-time quotes with pacing guards
   - Implement streaming adapter
   - Handle disconnection/reconnection gracefully

### Upcoming
4. **Live Trading Preparation (Phase 8)**
   - Create LiveExecutor with dry-run capability
   - Implement explicit live trading gates
   - Add operator checklist and documentation

## Known Issues / Blockers
- Virtual environment needs activation for tests
- No handoff documents existed before this one (now created)
- LLM integration not yet implemented (critical for intelligence-first approach)
- News pipeline not built
- Dashboard and AI trading scripts mentioned but not visible in main branch

## Risk Guardrails Active
✅ Paper trading as default  
✅ Daily loss limits enforced  
✅ Per-symbol exposure caps  
✅ Position sizing with ATR  
✅ Max leverage checks  
✅ No live trading without explicit flags  

## Database Files
- `trading.db` - Trading data storage
- `trading_data.db` - Additional trading data

## Documentation
- PROJECT_PLAN.md - Complete project phases and timeline
- TODO.md - Immediate and short-term tasks
- CLAUDE.md - Development guidelines and conventions
- Risk policy, configuration, and strategy docs in /docs

## Session Notes
- Created handoff directory structure as per CLAUDE.md convention
- This is the first handoff document for the project
- Main branch represents stable integration of Phases 1-4
- Ready to proceed with Phase 5 (Multi-Strategy/Eventing)

## Dependencies
Core: Python >=3.10, pandas, numpy, ib_insync  
Config: python-dotenv  
Tests: pytest  
Future: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, transformers, feedparser
