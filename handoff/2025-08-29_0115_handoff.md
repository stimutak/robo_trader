**Session Focus**: Phase 2 M2 - Enhance Walk-Forward Backtesting (28h task)

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the existing walk-forward backtesting framework by integrating the feature engineering pipeline (M1) and correlation-based position sizing (M5). The backtesting system now provides comprehensive ML-ready features and risk-aware position sizing during simulation.

## Work Completed

### Phase 2 Progress Update
- **M1: Feature Engineering Pipeline** ✅ COMPLETE
- **M5: Correlation Module Integration** ✅ COMPLETE  
- **M2: Walk-Forward Backtesting Enhancement** ✅ COMPLETE
- **M3: ML Model Training Pipeline** ⏳ Next (36h)
- **M4: Strategy Performance Analytics** ⏳ Pending (24h)

### M2 Enhancements Implemented

#### 1. Feature Engineering Integration (M1) ✅
- Added `generate_features()` method to WalkForwardBacktest
- Integrates all 4 indicator types: Momentum, Trend, Volatility, Volume
- Generates 25+ technical features automatically during backtesting
- Features available: RSI, Stochastic, MACD, ADX, ATR, Bollinger Bands, etc.

#### 2. Correlation-Based Position Sizing (M5) ✅  
- Integrated CorrelationTracker and CorrelationBasedPositionSizer
- Dynamic position size adjustment based on portfolio correlations
- Reduces positions when correlation > 0.7
- Rejects positions when correlation > 0.95

#### 3. Multi-Symbol Backtesting ✅
- New `run_multi_symbol_backtest()` method
- Supports backtesting across multiple correlated assets
- Updates correlation matrix with all symbols
- Applies correlation-based sizing across portfolio

#### 4. Enhanced Configuration ✅
Added to WalkForwardConfig:
```python
# Feature engineering settings
use_technical_features: bool = True
momentum_window: int = 14
trend_window: int = 20
volatility_window: int = 20
volume_window: int = 20

# Correlation settings  
use_correlation_sizing: bool = True
max_correlation: float = 0.7
correlation_penalty_factor: float = 0.5
```

## Files Modified

1. **robo_trader/backtest/walk_forward.py**:
   - Added imports for features and correlation modules
   - Enhanced WalkForwardConfig with new parameters
   - Added `generate_features()` method
   - Integrated correlation sizing in `_run_backtest_period()`
   - Added `run_multi_symbol_backtest()` method
   - Total: +182 lines, -5 lines

2. **Removed unnecessary file**:
   - Deleted `enhanced_backtest.py` (followed CLAUDE.md guideline to modify existing files)

## Test Results

### Test Script: `test_walk_forward_enhanced.py`
```
✅ All tests passed
- Generated 500 days of test data for 3 symbols
- Ran 9 walk-forward windows
- Generated 25 technical features
- Built 3x3 correlation matrix
- Tracked execution costs (slippage + commission)
```

### Performance Metrics Captured:
- Out-of-sample Sharpe ratio
- Win rate across windows
- Average slippage: $6.87
- Average commission: $15.00
- Stability metrics between train/test periods

## Running the Enhanced Backtest

### Basic Usage:
```python
from robo_trader.backtest.walk_forward import WalkForwardBacktest, WalkForwardConfig

config = WalkForwardConfig(
    use_technical_features=True,  # Enable M1 features
    use_correlation_sizing=True,  # Enable M5 sizing
    max_correlation=0.7
)

wf = WalkForwardBacktest(config)
results = await wf.run_multi_symbol_backtest(data, engine, params)
```

### Test the System:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_walk_forward_enhanced.py
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (M3: ML Model Training Pipeline - 36h):
1. Create automated training for RF, XGBoost, Neural Networks
2. Implement hyperparameter tuning
3. Build model selection framework
4. Create model performance tracking

### Then (M4: Strategy Performance Analytics - 24h):
1. Implement comprehensive risk-adjusted metrics
2. Create performance attribution analysis
3. Build reporting dashboard

## Integration Points

The enhanced walk-forward backtest now connects:
- **M1 Features** → Generates 25+ technical indicators
- **M5 Correlation** → Applies risk-aware position sizing
- **Execution Simulator** → Realistic market impact modeling
- **Metrics Module** → Comprehensive performance analytics

## Known Limitations

1. **Monte Carlo**: Currently set to 100 simulations for testing (should be 1000+ for production)
2. **Feature Selection**: Using fixed set of features, no dynamic selection yet
3. **ML Models**: Not yet integrated (coming in M3)

## Environment Status
- Python venv: Activated
- All tests passing
- Git: 2 commits ahead (M5 and M2)
- Market Status: Closed

## Time Tracking
- Estimated: 28 hours
- Actual: ~1.5 hours (leveraged existing comprehensive framework)
- Efficiency gain: 95% time saved by enhancing existing code

## Key Decisions
1. **Modified existing file** instead of creating new one (per CLAUDE.md)
2. **Integrated M1 and M5** to create unified backtesting framework
3. **Kept backward compatibility** - existing code still works

## Notes
- M2 completes the backtesting infrastructure for Phase 2
- System ready for ML model integration (M3)
- All Phase 2 foundational components now in place
- Walk-forward framework properly validates out-of-sample performance
