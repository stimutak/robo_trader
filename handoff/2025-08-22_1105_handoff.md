## Known Issues & Limitations

### Crypto Trading (Cannot Fix - IB Limitation)
- BTC-USD and ETH-USD show "No data" in paper trading
- Interactive Brokers paper accounts don't support cryptocurrency
- Code is ready but requires live IB account with crypto permissions
- Errors in logs: "Unable to qualify crypto contract for BTCUSD/ETHUSD"

### Current Warnings
- Options flow scanning attempts crypto as Stock type (should be ignored)
- Claude API occasionally returns 529 (overloaded) but retries successfully
- Some company event analysis failing with "'str' object has no attribute 'get'"

## Active Features
- **News Analysis**: Processing Fed speeches and market news every 5 minutes
- **Company Intelligence**: Monitoring SEC filings (8-K, Form 4) for all symbols
- **Options Flow**: Scanning for unusual options activity
- **Price Updates**: Fetching prices every minute for all supported symbols

## Current Performance
- **Symbols Tracked**: 22 (19 stocks, 1 gold ETF, 2 crypto [not working])

- **Company Events**: 9 unique events detected (8-K filings, insider trades)
- **P&L**: Sample data showing ~$400 profit (test data)
- **Active Prices**: All stocks and GLD updating correctly

## Next Steps Recommended
1. **Remove crypto from default symbols** until live account available
2. **Fix company event analysis** error in ai_runner.py
3. **Implement actual trading logic** (currently only monitoring)
4. **Add position management UI** to dashboard
5. **Create trade execution buttons** for manual override
