- Trading: Positions, P&L, order metrics
- Performance: Latency, error rates
- Components: Individual service status

### Alert Rules
- Trading system down
- High daily loss
- IBKR disconnection
- Resource exhaustion
- High error rates

## Production Deployment Commands

```bash
# Local Development
docker-compose up -d

# Build Docker Image
docker build -t robo_trader:latest .

# Deploy to Kubernetes
./scripts/deploy.sh staging v1.0.0

# Check Health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# View Metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics

# Emergency Stop
python -c "from robo_trader.production import EmergencyStopManager, StopReason; 
m = EmergencyStopManager(); 
m.emergency_stop(StopReason.MANUAL)"

# Check Deployment
kubectl get pods -n trading
kubectl logs -f -n trading -l app=robo-trader
```
