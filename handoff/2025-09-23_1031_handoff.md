## Session Summary
**Session Focus:** TWS API Connection Issue - Deep Troubleshooting
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Result:** Issue NOT resolved - TWS API handshake still failing

## Current Status: ❌ BLOCKED

### The Problem
TWS accepts TCP connections but fails to complete the API handshake. The `apiStart` event never fires, causing a timeout after 20 seconds.

**Error Pattern:**
```
Connected (TCP socket established) ✓
Waiting for apiStart event...
TimeoutError after 20 seconds ✗
```

## Attempted Fixes (ALL FAILED)

### 1. Library Migration ✅ (Completed but didn't fix connection)
- **Action:** Migrated from `ib_insync` to `ib_async` v2.0.1
- **Reason:** ib_insync is unmaintained (author passed away early 2024)
- **Result:** Migration successful, but connection issue persists
- **Conclusion:** Not a library issue

### 2. TWS Configuration ✅ (Fixed but didn't resolve)
- **Action:** Set Master API client ID from blank to 0
- **Action:** Restarted TWS after config change
- **Result:** Simple test with client ID 999 works, but runner still fails
- **Conclusion:** Config is correct, issue is elsewhere

### 3. Client ID Range Change ✅ (Implemented but didn't fix)
- **File:** `/robo_trader/runner_async.py` line 436
- **Change:** `random.randint(10, 200)` → `random.randint(900, 1000)`
- **Reason:** Client ID 999 works in simple test
- **Result:** Still fails with timeout
- **Conclusion:** Not a client ID conflict issue

### 4. Connection Method Change ✅ (Implemented but didn't fix)
- **File:** `/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py` line 158
- **Change:** `ib.connect()` → `await ib.connectAsync()`
- **Reason:** Better async compatibility
- **Result:** Still fails with timeout
- **Conclusion:** Not a sync/async issue

### 5. Event Loop Patching ✅ (Tested both ways)
- **File:** `/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py` line 23
- **Tested:** Both with and without `patchAsyncio()`
- **With patch:** Timeout after 20 seconds
- **Without patch:** "This event loop is already running" error
- **Conclusion:** patchAsyncio() is required, but not the cause

## Key Observations

### What Works ✅
```python
# Simple test - WORKS
python3 -c "from ib_async import IB; ib = IB(); ib.connect('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=999, timeout=5); print('SUCCESS!')"
```

### What Fails ❌
```python
# Runner - FAILS
python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA
```

### The Mystery
Both use the same:
- Port (7497)
- Host (127.0.0.1)
- Library (ib_async)
- Client ID range (900-1000)

Yet simple test succeeds while runner fails.

## Technical Details

### Connection Flow
1. TCP socket connects successfully ✓
2. Client sends handshake
3. TWS should respond with API version
4. TWS should fire `apiStart` event
5. **FAILURE:** Step 3-4 never happen in runner context

### Error Location
- File: `/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py`
- Line: 158 (connectAsync call)
- Timeout: 20 seconds waiting for `apiStart`

### Current Code State
```python
# /robo_trader/runner_async.py line 436
random_client_id = random.randint(900, 1000)  # Changed from (10, 200)

# /robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py line 158
await ib.connectAsync(...)  # Changed from ib.connect()
```

## Running Processes
```bash
# WebSocket server (working)
PID varies - port 8765

# TWS (running but not responding to API)
JavaAppli PID 9922 - port 7497
```

## Next Steps to Try

### 1. Bypass Connection Pool
The runner uses a connection pool, simple test doesn't. Try direct connection without pool.

### 2. Check Retry Logic
The runner has retry logic with tenacity. Maybe retry is causing issues.

### 3. Timeout Investigation
Try increasing timeout beyond 20 seconds (60s or more).

### 4. TWS Version
Current TWS version: 10.39
Consider downgrading to older stable version.

### 5. IB Gateway Instead
Try IB Gateway (port 4001/4002) instead of TWS.

### 6. Network/Firewall
- Check if Malwarebytes is still interfering (was disabled but check again)
- Check macOS firewall settings
- Try with all security software disabled

## Files Modified This Session
- `/robo_trader/runner_async.py` - Client ID range change
- `/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py` - Connection method change
- `/robo_trader/CLAUDE.md` - Added troubleshooting notes
- All Python files - ib_insync → ib_async migration

## Root Cause Analysis

**Most Likely Cause:** Something in the runner's async context or connection pooling is preventing TWS from completing the API handshake. The fact that a simple synchronous test works but the async runner fails points to an environmental or contextual issue rather than a configuration problem.

**The issue is on our end** - specifically in how the runner creates and manages connections differently from a simple test script.

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Kill all processes
pkill -9 -f "runner_async"

# Simple test (WORKS)
python3 test_connection.py

# Runner test (FAILS)
python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL

# Check TWS connection
lsof -i :7497
```

## Session Notes
- User correctly identified that the problem is on our end
- Multiple fixes attempted but core issue remains
- Connection works in isolation but fails in runner context
- Need to investigate what's different about the runner environment
