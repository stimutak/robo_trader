**Date:** 2025-09-15  
**Time:** 16:26  
**Session:** AttributeError Fix & Dashboard Restoration

## Status Summary
✅ **RESOLVED:** Fixed critical AttributeError that was preventing trading system startup  
✅ **RESOLVED:** Restored full system operation (WebSocket, Trading Runner, Dashboard)  
✅ **RESOLVED:** Eliminated duplicate processes - system running with single clean instances
⚠️ **NOTE:** Many background bash processes remain from debugging - cleanup recommended

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. AttributeError Resolution
**Issue:** `'AsyncRunner' object has no attribute 'enable_short_selling'`  
**Location:** `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/runner_async.py` lines 1599, 1647  
**Fix Applied:** Changed `self.enable_short_selling` → `self.cfg.execution.enable_short_selling`

### 2. System Services Status
**WebSocket Server:** ✅ Running (PID: 74833, Port: 8765)  
**Trading Runner:** ✅ Running (PID: 74986, 75222)  
**Dashboard:** ✅ Running (PID: 75112, Port: 5555)  
**IBKR Gateway:** ✅ Connected (Port: 7497)

## Running Processes
- WebSocket Server: PID 74833 on port 8765
- Trading Runner: Multiple instances (PIDs: 74986, 75222) 
- Dashboard: PID 75112 on port 5555
- IBKR Java Application: PID 23893 on port 7497

## Current Clean System (16:38 Status)
After extensive debugging, the system is now running cleanly with:
- **Single WebSocket Server:** PID 78580 on port 8765 ✅
- **Single Trading Runner:** PID 79539 with 5 IBKR connections ✅  
- **Single Dashboard:** PID 79596 on port 5555 ✅
- **26 ML models loaded** and **14 existing positions** restored ✅

## Next Steps
1. **Background Process Cleanup:** Many dormant background bash processes remain from debugging - safe to ignore but could be cleaned up
2. **Monitor Performance:** System now has single instances, no duplicate trading
3. **Phase 3 Continuation:** Resume S5 task (Phase 3 is 80% complete, S1-S4 done)

## Files Modified
- `robo_trader/runner_async.py`: Fixed attribute access pattern for short selling configuration
- `process_manager.py`: Added process management with PID/lock files

## Session Notes
- Fixed critical attribute error that was blocking system startup
- Eliminated all duplicate processes through aggressive cleanup
- Dashboard accessible at http://localhost:5555  
- Trading system processing 19 symbols with async ML pipeline
- System logs show clean startup and active trading cycle

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Kill duplicate processes if needed
python3 process_manager.py cleanup

# Check system status
ps aux | grep -E "(websocket_server|runner_async|app.py)" | grep -v grep

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:5555
```

## Blockers
None - system fully operational
