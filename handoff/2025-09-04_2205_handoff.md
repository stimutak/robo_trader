Status
- Changes pending commit: 7 modified files, 2 new files.
- Key fixes: race condition in position updates, connection pool timeouts, rounding in risk sizing, stop-loss validation, timezone-aware metrics, float epsilon for validation, portfolio oversell clamp, WebSocket queue overflow protection.

Changed Files Since Last Commit
- robo_trader/runner_async.py: Added per-symbol asyncio locks and `_update_position_atomic()`; replaced direct position updates across buy/sell/short/cover flows; improved error handling and monitoring integration.
- robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py: `ConnectionPool.acquire()` now supports timeout with `asyncio.wait_for`; raises clear `ConnectionError` on exhaustion.
- robo_trader/risk.py: Position sizing now rounds to nearest share (vs truncation); added stop-loss distance validation (<=10%) and critical logging if stop should have triggered.
- robo_trader/data/pipeline.py: Metrics now use US/Eastern market time; timezone-aware gap detection to avoid false positives.
- robo_trader/data/validation.py: Added EPSILON tolerance to float comparisons; improved error messages and locked-market detection.
- robo_trader/portfolio.py: Prevent oversell by clamping to available shares; corrected realized PnL/cash; warn on oversell attempt.
- robo_trader/websocket_client.py: Bounded queue with overflow protection; drops oldest on full; shared safe queuing helper.

New Files
- CRITICAL_BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md: Consolidated write‑up of 8 critical fixes.
- tests/test_critical_bug_fixes.py: Regression tests covering all fixes above.

Running Processes
- None from this session (no long‑running jobs started here).

Next Steps
- Run targeted tests: `pytest -q tests/test_critical_bug_fixes.py`.
- Run full suite: `pytest -q` then `black . && isort . && flake8 robo_trader tests && mypy robo_trader`.
- Manual smoke: `python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,MSFT --duration "30 mins"` (paper mode) and watch for lock/position updates.
- Review CRITICAL_BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md and integrate any dashboard alerts for new critical logs (e.g., untriggered stop‑loss).

Blockers
- None identified. IBKR connectivity/timeouts should be re‑validated against real gateway settings.

Session Notes
- Focus was production hardening: concurrency safety, precision, and guardrails.
- Atomic position updates are now the single path for state mutations in runner_async.
- Risk rounding avoids systematic under‑allocation; stop‑loss checks add safety without auto‑liquidation yet (could be extended).
- WebSocket queue bounded to prevent memory growth under bursty updates.
