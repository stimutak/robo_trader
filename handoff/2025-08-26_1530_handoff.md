- `/robo_trader/features/ml_features.py` - ML feature calculations
- `/robo_trader/features/feature_pipeline.py` - Integrated pipeline
- `/robo_trader/analysis/correlation_integration.py` - Correlation position sizing
- `/robo_trader/backtest/walk_forward.py` - Walk-forward analysis
- `/robo_trader/backtest/execution_simulator.py` - Execution simulation

### Modified Files:
- `/robo_trader/runner_async.py` - Added correlation integration
- `/robo_trader/features/__init__.py` - Updated exports
- `/Dockerfile` - Fixed hadolint warnings

### Archived Files:
- `/robo_trader/archived/runner_sync_old.py` (was runner.py)
- `/robo_trader/archived/database_sync_old.py` (was database.py)  
- `/robo_trader/archived/ibkr_client_sync_old.py` (was ibkr_client.py)

## üöÄ How to Use New Features

### Run with Correlation-Based Position Sizing:
```bash
python -m robo_trader.runner_async \
    --symbols AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,META,AMZN \
    --max-concurrent 8 \
    --use-correlation-sizing \
    --max-correlation 0.7
```

### Use Feature Pipeline:
```python
from robo_trader.features import FeaturePipeline
from robo_trader.config import load_config

# Initialize pipeline
config = load_config()
pipeline = FeaturePipeline(config)

# Calculate features
features = await pipeline.calculate_features(
    symbol="AAPL",
    price_data=df,
    cross_asset_data={"SPY": spy_df},
    store_features=True
)

# Get top features
top_features = await pipeline.get_top_features(n=50)
```

### Run Walk-Forward Backtest:
```python
from robo_trader.backtest.walk_forward import WalkForwardBacktest

backtest = WalkForwardBacktest()
windows = backtest.create_windows(start_date, end_date)

for window in windows:
    result = await backtest.run_single_window(
        engine, train_data, test_data, parameters, window_id
    )

report = backtest.generate_report()
```

## üìä Phase 2 Metrics Achieved

‚úÖ 50+ real-time features with feature store operational
‚úÖ Correlation analysis integrated into trading pipeline
‚úÖ Walk-forward optimization with realistic simulation
‚úÖ Execution costs properly modeled (slippage, impact, commissions)

## üîÑ Next Steps - Remaining Phase 2 Tasks

### Priority Tasks:

1. **M3: ML Model Training Pipeline** (36h)
   - Random Forest implementation
   - XGBoost integration
   - Neural network models
   - Hyperparameter tuning framework
   - Model selection and validation
   - Files to create: `robo_trader/ml/model_trainer.py`

2. **M4: Performance Analytics** (24h)
   - Sharpe ratio calculation
   - Maximum drawdown tracking
   - Risk-adjusted returns
   - Performance attribution
   - Files to create: `robo_trader/analytics/performance.py`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### New Dependencies Needed:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm statsmodels
```

### Configuration Updates:
Add to config.yaml:
```yaml
features:
  enable_ml_features: true
  feature_store_path: "feature_store.db"
  
correlation:
  max_correlation: 0.7
  penalty_factor: 0.5
  update_interval: 300
```

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Test correlation sizing with highly correlated pairs (e.g., XLF/JPM)
2. Verify feature store persistence across restarts
3. Run walk-forward backtest on 1 year of data
4. Compare execution simulation costs to actual trading

## üîß Known Issues & TODOs

### Issues to Address:
- Feature store may grow large - implement cleanup job
- Correlation updates could be optimized with incremental calculation
- Walk-forward windows should align with market regimes

### Performance Optimizations:
- Feature calculation takes ~50ms per symbol
- Consider caching correlation matrix for 15 minutes
- Batch feature store writes for better performance

## üí° Tips for Next Session

1. **Start with M3** - ML models need the feature pipeline
2. **Use existing features** - Don't recreate feature engineering
3. **Test on paper trading** before live deployment
4. **Monitor feature importance** to reduce dimensionality
5. **Implement model versioning** for A/B testing
