## Session Summary
Fixed critical duplicate buying bug in trading system and improved dashboard real-time updates. The system was repeatedly buying the same positions every minute due to not loading existing positions on startup.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Buying Bug (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem**: System was buying the same stocks (UPST, TEM) every 60-90 seconds
**Root Cause**: 
- `runner_async.py` started with empty `self.positions = {}` dictionary
- Never loaded existing positions from database on startup
- Line 503 checked `elif symbol not in self.positions` but positions was always empty
- Result: System thought it owned nothing and kept buying

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `load_existing_positions()` method in `runner_async.py`
- Loads all positions from database during setup
- Now correctly tracks 18 existing positions
- Duplicate buying has stopped completely

**Impact**: Prevented potential massive overexposure and capital depletion

### 2. Dashboard Trade History Not Updating
**Problem**: Trade history only updated on dashboard restart
**Root Cause**: `loadTrades()` was not included in the 5-second refresh cycle
**Solution**: Added `loadTrades()` to `refreshData()` function
**Impact**: Trades now update in real-time every 5 seconds

### 3. Multiple Runner Processes
**Problem**: Two runner_async processes were running simultaneously
**Root Cause**: Old process didn't terminate when starting new one
**Solution**: Killed duplicate process, now only one runner with 19 symbols
**Impact**: Eliminated duplicate trades from competing processes

## Current System Status

### Running Processes
1. **Trading Runner** (bash_30)
   - Processing 19 symbols: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, IXHL, NUAI, BZAI, ELTP, OPEN, CEG, VRT, PLTR, UPST, TEM, HTFL, SDGR, APLD, SOFI, CORZ, WULF
   - Successfully loaded 18 existing positions on startup
   - Using ML Enhanced strategy
   - Connected to IB Gateway with client IDs 10-14

2. **Dashboard** (bash_31)
   - Running on port 5555: http://localhost:5555
   - Real-time trade updates every 5 seconds
   - Shows 78+ trades including today's activity
   - Market status indicator working (shows "Regular" during market hours)

3. **WebSocket Server** (bash_29)
   - Running on port 8765
   - Dashboard connected and receiving real-time price updates
   - Broadcasting market data for all symbols

### Database Status
- 78 total trades recorded
- 18 active positions with proper quantities
- Positions table correctly reflects holdings
- No duplicate trades since fix at 19:37

### IB Gateway Connection
- Status: Connected and stable
- All market data farms reporting OK
- Processing real-time data for all 19 symbols
- No connection drops in last 30 minutes

## Code Changes Made

### 1. runner_async.py
```python
# Added position loading method
async def load_existing_positions(self):
    """Load existing positions from database on startup to prevent duplicate buying."""
    try:
        positions_data = await self.db.get_positions()
        for pos in positions_data:
            if pos.get('quantity', 0) > 0:
                symbol = pos['symbol']
                quantity = pos['quantity']
                avg_cost = pos.get('avg_cost', pos.get('price', 0))
                self.positions[symbol] = Position(symbol, quantity, avg_cost)
                logger.info(f"Loaded existing position: {symbol} qty={quantity} avg_cost=${avg_cost:.2f}")
        logger.info(f"Loaded {len(self.positions)} existing positions from database")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to load existing positions: {e}")

# Added call in setup()
await self.load_existing_positions()
```

### 2. app.py
```python
# Fixed trades API endpoint (removed duplicate code)
# Added trades to refresh cycle
async function refreshData() {
    await Promise.all([
        loadStatus(),
        loadPnL(), 
        loadWatchlist(),
        loadPositions(),
        loadMLData(),
        loadPerformanceData(),
        loadTrades()  // Now refreshes every 5 seconds
    ]);
}
```

### 3. websocket_server.py
```python
# Added main block to run standalone
if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    loop.run_until_complete(ws_manager.start_server())
```

## Active Positions (No longer duplicating)
- APLD: 1193 shares @ $16.68
- UPST: 30 shares @ $66.48 (was buying every minute - FIXED)
- TEM: 25 shares @ $77.86 (was buying every minute - FIXED)
- NVDA: 102 shares @ $182.13
- Plus 14 other positions

## Why Only BUY Trades?
- ML Enhanced strategy showing Signal=0 (neutral) for all symbols
- Conservative strategy not generating SELL signals
- Normal behavior for momentum strategy in stable market
- Exit signals will trigger on:
  - Stop losses
  - Profit targets
  - Bearish ML predictions
  - Market regime changes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Monitor for any new duplicate trades (should be none)
2. Verify position quantities match actual holdings
3. Consider implementing additional safeguards

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Add position size limits** - Max shares per symbol
2. **Add daily trade limits** - Max trades per symbol per day
3. **Add duplicate trade detection** - Alert if same trade within X minutes
4. **Add process locking** - Prevent multiple runners on same account
5. **Implement position reconciliation** - Compare database vs broker positions

### Phase 3 - Task S5 (Regime Detection)
Ready to proceed with implementation once duplicate trading issue is confirmed resolved

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Positions load on startup
- ✅ No duplicate trades after restart
- ✅ Dashboard updates trades in real-time
- ✅ WebSocket connection stable
- ✅ IB Gateway connection stable
- ✅ All 19 symbols processing correctly

## Important Notes
1. **Critical Fix**: The position loading fix is essential - without it, system will buy continuously
2. **Monitor Carefully**: Watch for any trades of identical quantity/symbol within short timeframes
3. **Single Process**: Ensure only one runner_async process is active at a time
4. **Database Integrity**: Position table must reflect actual holdings
