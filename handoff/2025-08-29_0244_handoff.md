   - Added new key project files for Phase 2 components
   - Updated testing commands for ML pipeline

## Current Project Status

### Phase Completion
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Foundation & Quick Wins (100% Complete)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: ML Infrastructure & Backtesting (100% Complete)
- üöß **Phase 3**: Advanced Strategy Development (Starting)
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Production Hardening & Deployment

### Phase 2 Achievements
All 5 tasks successfully implemented:
1. **M1**: Feature engineering pipeline with 25+ indicators
2. **M2**: Walk-forward backtesting with realistic simulation
3. **M3**: ML model training (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks)
4. **M4**: Strategy performance analytics and attribution
5. **M5**: Correlation module integration

### System Capabilities
The platform now has:
- Complete ML infrastructure for feature generation
- Model training and selection framework
- Comprehensive backtesting capabilities
- Performance analytics with 20+ metrics
- Risk-aware position sizing via correlation

## Next Steps: Phase 3

### S1: ML-Driven Strategy Framework (Priority)
First task for Phase 3 (40 hours estimated):
- Create strategies using ML predictions
- Implement regime detection
- Multi-timeframe analysis
- Files: `robo_trader/strategies/ml_strategy.py`, `robo_trader/strategies/regime_detector.py`

### Remaining Phase 3 Tasks
- S2: Smart Execution Algorithms (32h)
- S3: Multi-Strategy Portfolio Manager (36h)
- S4: Microstructure Strategies (28h)
- S5: Mean Reversion Suite (24h)

## Files Changed
1. `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Phase 2 marked complete
2. `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/README.md` - Complete overhaul with ML features
3. `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/CLAUDE.md` - Updated phase status and files
4. Created this handoff document

## Running the System

### Test ML Infrastructure
```bash
# Full ML pipeline test
python test_ml_pipeline.py

# Model training test
python test_m3_complete.py

# Performance analytics test
python test_m4_performance.py

# Trading system with ML
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA
```

### Access Results
- Trained models: `trained_models/` directory
