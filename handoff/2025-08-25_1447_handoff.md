## Critical Issue - Dashboard Price Data Stopped at 10:00 AM
**User reported: "price data that is displayed stopped at 10am"**
- This indicates market data collection or display issue
- Need to investigate timestamp handling and data retrieval

## System State
- **AI Trading System**: Running with client ID retry issues (AttributeError on Position.entry_price)
- **Dashboard**: Enhanced dashboard recovered at http://localhost:5555
- **Database**: SQLite operational but data flow issues
- **IB Gateway**: Connection cycling through client IDs (10-13)

## Recent Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard Recovery
- **Issue**: Dashboard reverted to basic version, lost all custom features
- **Resolution**: Recovered from `options-flow-enhancement` branch to `app_enhanced.py`
- **Status**: Running but multiple features not working

### 2. Database Compatibility
- **Resolution**: Added missing methods to `robo_trader/database.py`:
  - `get_current_day_prices()`, `get_last_pnl_history()`, `get_today_pnl()`, `close()`

### 3. IB Client ID Conflicts
- **Partial Fix**: Retry logic implemented but still seeing conflicts
- **Current Issue**: Position object missing entry_price attribute

## Active Problems

### 1. Price Data Cutoff at 10:00 AM
- Dashboard shows price data only until 10:00 AM
- Need to check:
  - Database timestamps in market_data table
  - Flask API date filtering logic
  - Trading system data collection timestamps

### 2. Position.entry_price AttributeError
```
File "/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/runner.py", line 141
market_prices = {symbol: pos.entry_price for symbol, pos in positions.items()}
AttributeError: 'Position' object has no attribute 'entry_price'
```
- Need to fix Position object attribute access

### 3. Dashboard Features Not Working:
- Only AAPL, NVDA, TSLA showing prices
- No P&L history
- No AI conviction indicators  
- No pulsing live indicator
- Stale news feed
- No AI analysis

## Running Processes
- `python start_ai_trading.py` - Trading system (with errors)
- `python app_enhanced.py` - Enhanced dashboard

## Recent Log Activity
- 14:41: First iteration completed successfully, stored 138 bars per symbol
- 14:46: Second iteration failed with Position.entry_price error
- Trade recorded: BUY 40 BAC @ 49.44
- Client ID conflicts continuing (IDs 10-13 in use)

## Database Investigation Needed
```sql
-- Check latest timestamps in market_data
SELECT symbol, MAX(timestamp), COUNT(*) 
FROM market_data 
GROUP BY symbol;

-- Check if data after 10am exists
SELECT * FROM market_data 
WHERE time(timestamp) > '10:00:00' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Files Modified
1. `app_enhanced.py` - 3122-line recovered dashboard
2. `robo_trader/database.py` - Compatibility methods added
3. `robo_trader/ibkr_client.py` - Client ID retry logic
4. `robo_trader/runner.py` - Market data storage (has bug at line 141)

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Fix Position.entry_price error** in runner.py line 141
2. **Investigate 10am data cutoff** - Check database and API
3. **Debug dashboard data retrieval** for missing symbols
4. **Restore live features** - P&L, AI, news

## Environment
- Virtual env: `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/.venv`
- Database: `trading_data.db`
- Logs: `ai_trading.log`, `dashboard_enhanced.log`
- Git branch: main

## Session Context
- User frustrated about lost features and data issues
- Enhanced dashboard recovered but not fully functional
- Trading system running but with errors
- Data flow partially working (only until 10am)
