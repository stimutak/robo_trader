# Latest Handoff

See `handoff/2025-11-11_1052_handoff.md` for the current session handoff covering PR #48 merge and connection timing issue diagnosis.

**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Account data synchronization timing issue identified

**Key Finding**: Gateway IS working and sending account data, but subprocess worker calls `managedAccounts()` before data arrives. This is a **timing/synchronization issue**, not a Gateway configuration problem.

**Next Steps**: Fix account retrieval in `ibkr_subprocess_worker.py` to wait for data synchronization (polling with longer delays or waiting for IB events).
