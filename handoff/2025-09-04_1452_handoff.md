## Session Summary
Connected PerformanceMonitor metrics to dashboard UI and resolved database locking issues preventing the trading system from running.

## Work Completed

### 1. Dashboard Enhancements
- **Market Status Indicator**: Added real-time market status indicator to dashboard header
  - Shows Regular/Pre-Market/After-Hours/Closed status
  - Updates every 30 seconds via `/api/market-status` endpoint
  - Color-coded: green for open, yellow for extended hours, red for closed

### 2. Performance Monitor Integration
- **API Endpoint**: Created `/api/performance-monitor` endpoint in `app.py`
  - Loads metrics from `/tmp/robo_trader_metrics.pkl` pickle file
  - Fixed to work whether trading process is running or not
  - Returns comprehensive metrics (latency, throughput, trading activity)
  
- **Dashboard UI**: Added Performance tab with real-time metrics display
  - Latency metrics: Data fetch, signal generation, order execution, DB writes
  - Throughput metrics: Symbols/sec, orders/min, data points/sec
  - Trading activity: Orders placed, trades executed, success rates
  - Updates automatically every 2 seconds

### 3. Database Issues Resolution
- **Database Locking**: Resolved persistent SQLite locking errors
  - Killed stuck Python processes holding database locks
  - Removed journal file (`trading_data.db-journal`)
  - Created recovery scripts for future issues

### 4. IB Connection Configuration
- **Port Configuration**: Dashboard running on port 5555 (avoiding macOS AirPlay on 5000)
- **Client ID Management**: Tested multiple client IDs (200, 400, 555, 777)
- **Connection Status**: IB Gateway connected but experiencing stability issues

## Current Status

### Running Processes
- **Dashboard**: Running on port 5555 (`export DASH_PORT=5555 && python app.py`)
  - Background process ID: bash_25
  - Accessible at http://localhost:5555

### Active Issues
1. **IB Connection Instability**:
   - "Connectivity between Trader Workstation and server is broken"
   - "Market data farm connection is broken" errors
   - Requires IB Gateway/TWS restart or configuration check

2. **Real-time Data**: 
   - Metrics showing zeros until trading system actively processes symbols
   - Need runner_async.py to export metrics to pickle file

## Files Modified
- `app.py`: Added market status indicator, performance monitor endpoint, UI updates
- `robo_trader/runner_async.py`: Added export_performance_metrics method (restored from git after corruption)
- `robo_trader/config.py`: Configuration updates
- `robo_trader/market_hours.py`: Market hours checking
- `robo_trader/portfolio_manager.py`: Portfolio management updates
- Created: `test_performance_metrics.py`, `init_database.py`, `recover_database.py`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix IB Connection**:
   - Check IB Gateway configuration and restart if needed
   - Verify API settings in IB Gateway (Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients)
   - Consider using a stable client ID (e.g., 1 or 2)

2. **Test Trading System**:
   ```bash
   python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA --use-ml-enhanced
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance Metrics**:
   - Dashboard at http://localhost:5555
   - Check Performance tab for real-time metrics
   - Verify metrics are updating when runner is active

### Phase 3 - Task S5 (Regime Detection)
Once IB connection is stable, proceed with:
1. Implement market regime detection (bull/bear/sideways)
2. Volatility regime classification
3. Trend strength indicators
4. Strategy adaptation based on regime

## Environment Notes
- Platform: macOS Darwin 24.5.0
- Python: 3.9+ in virtual environment
- IB Gateway: Running but experiencing connection issues
- Database: SQLite with resolved locking issues

## Commands Reference
```bash
# Run dashboard
export DASH_PORT=5555
python app.py

# Run trading system
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA

# Check database
sqlite3 trading_data.db ".tables"

# Monitor processes
ps aux | grep python

# Kill stuck processes
pkill -f runner_async
```

## Session Notes
- User emphasized NO FAKE DATA - system must use real metrics from actual trading
- Database locking was the key blocker preventing system from running
- Dashboard successfully moved to port 5555 to avoid macOS conflicts
- Performance metrics integration complete but needs active trading to show real data
