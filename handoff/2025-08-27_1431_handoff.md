**Date:** 2025-08-27 14:31 PST
**Session:** Added Market Hours Checking & Real-Time WebSocket Updates

## Current Status

### âœ… Running Processes
- **Dashboard:** Not currently running (WebSocket connection issues)
- **Trading System:** Not currently running
- **IB TWS:** Running on port 7497

### ðŸ”„ System State
- **Database:** SQLite with clean data
  - 1 position: 10 shares NVDA @ $182.02
  - 19 symbols in watchlist
  - Market data collection working
- **Trading Mode:** Paper trading
- **Market Hours:** System now respects market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

## Features Added This Session

### 1. âœ… Market Hours Checking - COMPLETE
**Implementation:** 
- Created `market_hours.py` module with utilities
- Updated `runner_async.py` to check market status
- Data collection only happens during market hours
- Graceful handling of after-hours and weekends

**Key Functions:**
- `is_market_open()` - Check if market is currently open
- `get_market_session()` - Returns: "regular", "pre-market", "after-hours", "closed"
- `seconds_until_market_open()` - Time until next market open

**Behavior:**
- During market hours: Collects data every 5 minutes
- After hours/weekends: Checks less frequently, resumes automatically

### 2. âœ… Continuous Trading Mode - COMPLETE
**Changes:**
- Modified `runner_async.py` main() to run continuously by default
- Added `--once` flag for single run (testing)
- Added `--interval` flag to control cycle frequency (default: 300s)
- Built-in market hours awareness

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run continuously (default)
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,...

# Run once for testing
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --once --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA
```

### 3. ðŸŸ¡ Real-Time WebSocket Updates - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Implemented:**
- Created `websocket_server.py` for real-time broadcasting
- Added WebSocket client to dashboard HTML
- Integrated price/trade/signal updates in trading system
- Auto-reconnect functionality

**Issues:**
- WebSocket handler signature mismatch causing connection errors
- Port binding conflicts (port 8765)
- Dashboard shows "Real-time connection lost - reconnecting..." repeatedly

**What Works:**
- WebSocket server starts
- Client attempts to connect
- Update methods are integrated in trading system

**What Needs Fixing:**
- Fix WebSocket handler to properly accept connections
- Resolve logging serialization errors
- Ensure stable connection between client and server

## Next Steps

### 1. ðŸ”´ Fix WebSocket Connection Issues
- Debug handler signature problem in `websocket_server.py`
- Fix JSON serialization error with ServerConnection object
- Test stable real-time connection

### 2. ðŸŸ¡ Complete Real-Time Integration
- Verify all update types work (prices, trades, signals)
- Add performance metrics broadcasting
- Implement symbol-specific subscriptions

### 3. ðŸŸ¢ Add Trading Controls
- Buy/sell buttons in dashboard
- Position size calculator
- Stop-loss/take-profit controls

### 4. ðŸŸ¢ Fix Correlation Sizing
- Fix `update_price_history` method in correlation tracker
- Re-enable correlation-based position sizing

## Session Summary

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Market Hours Checking**
   - System now only collects equity data during market hours
   - Saves API calls and resources during off-hours
   - Automatic detection and resumption

2. **Continuous Trading**
   - Trading system now runs continuously by default
   - No need for external schedulers or cron jobs
   - Built-in interval control and graceful shutdown

3. **WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - Basic WebSocket server and client implemented
   - Integration points added throughout trading system
   - Foundation laid for real-time updates (needs debugging)

### Technical Decisions Made
1. Check market hours before fetching data (not after)
2. Use pytz for proper timezone handling
3. WebSocket on separate port (8765) from dashboard
4. Queue-based message broadcasting for thread safety

## Quick Commands

### Start Trading System (Continuous)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF
```

### Start Dashboard
```bash
export DASH_PORT=5555
python app.py
```

### Check Market Status
```bash
python test_market_hours.py
```

### View Logs
```bash
tail -f robo_trader.log      # Trading system
tail -f dashboard.log         # Dashboard
```

### Database Queries
```bash
sqlite3 trading_data.db "SELECT * FROM positions;"
sqlite3 trading_data.db "SELECT * FROM watchlist ORDER BY symbol;"
sqlite3 trading_data.db "SELECT symbol, COUNT(*), MAX(timestamp) FROM market_data GROUP BY symbol;"
```

## Files Modified This Session
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/market_hours.py` - NEW: Market hours utilities
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/runner_async.py` - Modified: Added market hours checking, continuous mode
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/websocket_server.py` - NEW: WebSocket server implementation
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/app.py` - Modified: Added WebSocket client and server startup
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/test_market_hours.py` - NEW: Test script for market hours

## Important Notes
- WebSocket implementation needs debugging before it's fully functional
- Trading system respects market hours automatically
- System bought 10 shares of NVDA during testing
- Dashboard needs restart after WebSocket fixes

## Known Issues
1. **WebSocket Connection Error**
   - `TypeError: WebSocketManager.handle_client() missing 1 required positional argument: 'path'`
   - Client shows continuous reconnection attempts
   - Needs handler signature fix

2. **Logging Serialization Error**
   - `TypeError: Object of type ServerConnection is not JSON serializable`
   - Occurs when WebSocket connections are logged
   - Need to exclude WebSocket objects from JSON logger

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - Port 8765 sometimes stays bound after crashes
   - May need to kill processes manually
