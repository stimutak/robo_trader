# Trading System Handoff - August 22, 2025, 11:51 AM PST

## Session Summary
Extensive debugging and fixes to the trading execution pipeline. The system can now execute trades but the AI is too conservative due to prompt settings. AI conviction display is partially working but stuck at 20%.

## Current System Status

### üü¢ Running Processes
- **Dashboard**: Running at http://localhost:5555 (PID: 44211)
- **AI Trading System**: Running (PID: 44548)
- **Market Status**: OPEN (11:51 AM PST / 2:51 PM EST)
- **Live Data**: Active and flowing

### AI Conviction Display Status
- **Display Shows**: 20% (static, not updating)
- **Actual Values**: 20-25% typical, occasional 65% on major Fed news
- **Issue**: Dashboard shows first value (20%) but doesn't update with new decisions

## Major Issues Identified & Fixed This Session

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Execution Pipeline Complete**
   - Fixed SignalEvent creation with proper parameters
   - Fixed Order class parameters (side, price)
   - Fixed conviction scaling (was multiplying by 100)
   - Fixed news analysis 'reasoning' field error
   - Lowered threshold from 75% to 50% for aggressive mode

2. **Crypto Symbols Removed**
   - Removed BTC-USD, ETH-USD from trading list
   - These aren't available on IB paper accounts

3. **AI Decision Push to Dashboard**
   - Added `_push_ai_decision_to_dashboard` function
   - Created `/api/ai_decision` endpoint
   - Added datetime imports for timestamps

### ‚ùå Remaining Issues

1. **AI Too Conservative**
   - Prompt explicitly says "Be conservative" 
   - Returns <30% conviction when uncertain
   - Most signals are 20-25% (below 50% threshold)
   - File: `intelligence.py` line 55

2. **AI Conviction Display Stuck**
   - Shows 20% and doesn't update
   - AI decisions are being generated but not pushed properly
   - Debug logging not showing "Pushed AI decision" messages
   - Likely async/await issue in push function

3. **Company Event Analysis Errors**
   - "'str' object has no attribute 'get'" errors
   - Events are detected but can't be analyzed

## Why No Trades Are Executing

1. **AI Conviction Too Low**: Most signals are 20-25%, need 50%+
2. **Conservative Prompt**: AI is told to be conservative
3. **Result**: System is analyzing but not trading

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **start_ai_trading.py**
   - Removed crypto symbols from DEFAULT_ASSETS

2. **robo_trader/ai_runner.py**
   - Lowered conviction threshold to 50%
   - Fixed SignalEvent creation
   - Fixed Order parameters
   - Added AI decision push to dashboard
   - Added datetime imports

3. **robo_trader/events.py**
   - Fixed conviction scaling (0-1 range)
   - Fixed reasoning field handling

4. **robo_trader/intelligence.py**
   - NO CHANGES (per user request - must get approval first)
   - Conservative prompt remains: "Be conservative and data-driven"

5. **app.py**
   - Added `/api/ai_decision` endpoint
   - Receives AI decisions for conviction gauge

## Conviction Score Analysis

### Current Behavior
- **20% conviction**: Neutral/uncertain (most common)
- **25% conviction**: Slight directional bias
- **65% conviction**: Strong signal (rare, only on major Fed news)

### Why So Low
```python
# Line 55 in intelligence.py:
"Be conservative and data-driven. Only suggest trades with clear catalysts 
and asymmetric risk/reward. If uncertain, return neutral with conviction < 30."
```

### To Enable Trading
Need ONE of:
1. Change prompt to be more aggressive (requires approval)
2. Lower threshold to 20-30% (not recommended)
3. Wait for high-impact events (65%+ signals are rare)

## Debug Log Insights

### What's Working
- AI is analyzing events (20-65% conviction)
- Event processing pipeline works
- Order creation works when conviction >= 50%
- Database persistence works

### What's Not Working
- AI decisions not updating on dashboard (stuck at 20%)
- Company event analysis fails with attribute error
- No trades because conviction < 50% threshold

## Next Priority Actions

1. **Fix AI Conviction Display Update**
   - Debug why display stuck at 20%
   - Check async/await in push function
   - Verify WebSocket or polling mechanism

2. **Get Approval for AI Prompt Change**
   - Current: "Be conservative" ‚Üí <30% when uncertain
   - Proposed: "Be decisive for aggressive trading" ‚Üí 60-80% typical
   - This is the PRIMARY blocker for trading

3. **Fix Company Event Analysis**
   - Debug 'str' object attribute error
   - Currently all 8-K and insider trades fail to analyze

## Configuration Notes

### Trading Parameters
- **Mode**: Paper Trading
- **Risk Level**: Aggressive (per user)
- **Conviction Threshold**: 50% (lowered from 75%)
- **Actual Conviction**: 20-25% typical (TOO LOW)
- **Capital**: $100,000
- **Symbols**: 20 stocks + GLD (removed crypto)

### AI Settings
- **Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet Latest
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (conservative)
- **Prompt**: Conservative (blocks trading)

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Restart system
./restart_trading.sh

# Check logs
tail -f ai_trading.log | grep -E "conviction|signal|Executed"

# Check if AI decisions being pushed
tail -f ai_trading.log | grep "Pushed AI decision"

# Monitor dashboard API
curl http://localhost:5555/api/status | jq '.ai_decisions'
```

## Critical Path to Trading

1. **MUST DO**: Change AI prompt (requires user approval)
2. **OR**: Lower threshold to 20% (not recommended)
3. **THEN**: Fix dashboard conviction display update
4. **FINALLY**: System will execute trades

## Session Notes

- User was frustrated that AI conviction display shows "--" then stuck at 20%
- User explicitly said NOT to change prompts without approval
- System is technically capable of trading but AI is too conservative
- 65% conviction signals do occur but are rare (major Fed news only)
- Dashboard conviction gauge receives first value but doesn't update
