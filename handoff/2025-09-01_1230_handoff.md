## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `train_high_accuracy.py` - Achieved 56.2% accuracy
- `train_advanced_models.py` - Advanced feature engineering
- `train_breakthrough_model.py` - Attempted 60%+ (learned limits)
- `sample_data.py` - Sample data for dashboard
- `sync_db_reader.py` - Sync database reader
- `simple_recover.py` - Database recovery tool

### Modified Files
- `app.py` - Extensive dashboard improvements
- `robo_trader/config.py` - Configuration updates
- `trained_models/*.pkl` - New and updated models

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Database Locking
- **Problem**: AsyncTradingDatabase causes persistent locks
- **Solution**: Use sync_db_reader.py for dashboard queries
- **Status**: Resolved âœ…

### Issue 2: Model Accuracy Ceiling
- **Problem**: Can't break 60% accuracy
- **Reality**: Markets are efficient, 55-60% is professional level
- **Solution**: Focus on risk management and high-confidence trades
- **Status**: Accepted âœ…

### Issue 3: Dashboard Performance
- **Problem**: Slow with database queries
- **Solution**: Implemented caching and sample data fallback
- **Status**: Resolved âœ…

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Monitor model performance in live trading
2. Implement proper position sizing based on confidence
3. Add stop-loss and take-profit logic

### Short-term
1. Implement intraday models (higher frequency = more predictability)
2. Add portfolio optimization (Kelly criterion)
3. Create model retraining pipeline

### Long-term
1. Add alternative data sources (sentiment, options flow)
2. Implement ensemble voting system
3. Create automated hyperparameter tuning

## Trading Strategy Recommendations

Based on ML model analysis:
1. **Focus on high-confidence trades** (>60% probability = 61% accuracy)
2. **Use lag features** - Previous days' patterns are most predictive
3. **Trade liquid ETFs** - Cleaner patterns than individual stocks
4. **Risk management** - 56% edge is profitable with proper sizing

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run dashboard
export DASH_PORT=5555 && python app.py

# Train ML models
python train_high_accuracy.py  # Best results
python train_models.py          # Standard training

# Database recovery
python simple_recover.py        # Restore from backup

# Run trading system
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA...
```

## Session Notes

### ML Training Insights
