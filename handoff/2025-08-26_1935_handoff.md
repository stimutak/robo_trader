**Date:** 2025-08-26 19:35 PST
**Session:** Dashboard Integration with Real-Time Database Connection

## Current Status

### âœ… Running Processes
- **Dashboard:** Running on port 5555 (http://localhost:5555)
  - PID: Check with `lsof -i :5555`
  - Connected to real SQLite database
  - Showing 15 real positions from database
  
- **Trading System:** Connected to Interactive Brokers TWS
  - Successfully fetched data for all 19 user symbols
  - Timestamp error prevents continuous operation (exits after one cycle)

### ðŸ”„ System State
- **Database:** SQLite database with real trading data
  - 15 existing positions (IWM, PG, BAC, etc.) from previous sessions
  - Account balance: $100,000 default
  - Connection pool: 5 async connections

- **User Symbols Configured:** All 19 from user_settings.json
  - AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, IXHL, NUAI, BZAI, ELTP, OPEN, CEG
  - VRT, PLTR, UPST, TEM, HTFL, SDGR, APLD, SOFI, CORZ, WULF

## Next Steps

### 1. ðŸ”´ Critical - Fix Timestamp Database Error
**Issue:** "Error binding parameter 2: type 'Timestamp' is not supported"
**Location:** `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/runner_async.py:200`
**Solution:** Convert pandas Timestamp to datetime before database insertion
```python
# In fetch_and_store_data function, convert:
timestamp = bar.date.to_pydatetime() if hasattr(bar.date, 'to_pydatetime') else bar.date
```

### 2. ðŸŸ¡ Important - Complete Real-Time Data Flow
- Wire up WebSocket connections for live price updates
- Remove polling in favor of push updates
- Connect strategy signals to dashboard

### 3. ðŸŸ¢ Enhancement - Add Trading Controls
- Add buy/sell buttons in dashboard
- Implement position size calculator
- Add stop-loss/take-profit controls

## Blockers

### Timestamp Conversion Issue
- **Problem:** Pandas Timestamp objects can't be stored directly in SQLite
- **Impact:** Trading system can't store fetched market data
- **Workaround:** System fetches data successfully but can't persist it

## Session Notes

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Dashboard Overhaul**
   - Consolidated two dashboard implementations into one
   - Added ML integration tabs
   - Connected to real database (removed mock data)
   - Fixed scope issues with `default_symbols`

2. **Symbol Configuration** 
   - Integrated user_settings.json
   - Dashboard now uses all 19 user-configured symbols
   - Fixed subprocess command to properly pass comma-separated symbols

3. **Real Data Connection**
   - Dashboard fetches real positions from SQLite
   - Shows actual P&L from account table
   - No more random/changing mock data

### User Feedback
- User noticed dashboard showing old version - fixed by restart
- User wanted all 19 symbols - successfully implemented
- User noticed positions changing every few seconds - fixed by removing random generation
- User requested real data connection - successfully implemented

### Technical Decisions Made
1. Used async database connections for non-blocking I/O
2. Implemented connection pooling for efficiency
3. Kept Flask for simplicity (considered FastAPI but stayed with Flask)
4. Used global variables for state (not ideal but functional)

## Quick Commands

### Check Running Services
```bash
lsof -i :5555  # Dashboard
lsof -i :7497  # IB TWS
ps aux | grep python | grep -E "(app.py|runner_async)"
```

### Restart Dashboard
```bash
kill $(lsof -t -i:5555)
cd /Users/oliver/robo_trader
source venv/bin/activate
export DASH_PORT=5555
python app.py
```

### Start Trading System
```bash
# From dashboard UI or:
python -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF
```

### View Logs
```bash
tail -f dashboard.log
tail -f ai_trading.log
```
