- Performance analytics: All metrics calculated correctly
- Walk-forward backtest: Framework operational (6 windows created)
- ML models: Ready but need multi-row feature data for training

## 🔄 Next Phase - Phase 3: Strategy Framework

### Priority Tasks for Phase 3:

1. **Strategy Base Classes** (Week 9)
   - Abstract strategy interface
   - Signal generation framework
   - Position management
   - Risk controls per strategy

2. **Core Strategies** (Week 10)
   - Mean reversion strategy
   - Momentum strategy
   - Breakout strategy
   - Statistical arbitrage

3. **Strategy Optimization** (Week 11)
   - Parameter optimization
   - Walk-forward validation
   - Strategy combination
   - Portfolio allocation

4. **Live Integration** (Week 12)
   - Paper trading validation
   - Performance monitoring
   - Strategy switching logic
   - Emergency controls

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking):
1. Feature pipeline generates single-row output (designed for real-time)
2. BacktestEngine expects `initial_capital` in Config (needs mapping)
3. Some verbose logging in test output

### To Address:
- Consider batch feature generation for historical backtesting
- Map `default_cash` to `initial_capital` for BacktestEngine
- Configure log levels for cleaner test output

## 💡 Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Begin Phase 3** with strategy framework implementation
2. **Test ML models** with real multi-symbol data in production
3. **Run full backtest** with correlation sizing and ML features
4. **Monitor feature importance** to optimize feature set
5. **Deploy to paper trading** for real-world validation
