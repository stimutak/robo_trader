## Session Summary
Fixed news ticker display issue and redesigned dashboard with Cursor.com minimal aesthetic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed News Feed Display
**Issue**: Dashboard showed "Loading market news..." despite system actively fetching news
**Root Cause**: Missing aiohttp dependency prevented news from being POSTed to dashboard
**Solution**:
- Added aiohttp to requirements.txt
- Fixed error handling in `_push_news_to_dashboard` method in ai_runner.py
- News now successfully flows from AI runner to dashboard

### 2. Dashboard UI Redesign - Cursor.com Style
**Changes**: Complete redesign to match Cursor.com minimal aesthetic
- Black background (#0a0a0a) with dark surfaces (#111111)
- Grey text (#8b8b8b) instead of white
- Light blue accent color (#4a9eff) for interactive elements
- Removed all gradients and fancy animations
- Clean, minimal design with subtle borders

### 3. Symbol Coverage Fix (Previous Session)
**Issue**: System only monitoring 5 symbols instead of full 21-symbol watchlist
**Fix**: Removed hardcoded limit in news.py line 220

## Current Status
✅ System running successfully
✅ News ticker displaying real-time market news with sentiment
✅ AI analyzing events with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
✅ Dashboard has clean Cursor-style minimal design
✅ Monitoring all 21 symbols in watchlist

## Files Modified
1. `/robo_trader/ai_runner.py` - Fixed news push error handling
2. `/requirements.txt` - Added aiohttp, flask, flask-cors, feedparser
3. `/app.py` - Complete UI redesign with Cursor aesthetic
4. `/robo_trader/news.py` - Fixed symbol limit (previous session)

## Verification Steps
```bash
# Check news is flowing
curl -s http://localhost:5555/api/status | python3 -m json.tool | grep news_feed

# Should see news items with:
# - title (truncated to 100 chars)
# - source (bloomberg, cnbc, etc.)
# - sentiment score
# - timestamp
```

## Next Tasks (TODO)
1. Add real-time price charts
2. Create AI conviction gauge visualization  
3. Improve P&L display with charts
4. Add position entry/exit indicators

## Notes
- News updates every 5 minutes from 9+ RSS feeds
- AI analyzes high-impact news (relevance > 0.4)
- Dashboard polls /api/status every 2 seconds
- System uses paper trading by default
