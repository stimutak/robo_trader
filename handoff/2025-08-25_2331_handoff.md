## Current Status
**Phase 3 COMPLETE** - Strategy Framework and Backtesting Engine fully implemented and tested.

## Running Processes
None - All tests completed, no active processes.

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Implemented Complete Strategy Framework**
   - Base Strategy class with standardized interface (`robo_trader/strategies/framework.py`)
   - Signal generation, validation, and risk management integration
   - Position tracking and state management

2. **Created Three Trading Strategies**
   - Enhanced Momentum Strategy (`strategies/momentum.py`) - RSI, MACD, volume analysis
   - Mean Reversion Strategy (`strategies/mean_reversion.py`) - Bollinger Bands, Z-score
   - Breakout Strategy (`strategies/breakout.py`) - Support/resistance detection

3. **Built Backtesting Engine**
   - Event-driven backtesting (`backtest/engine.py`)
   - Transaction costs and slippage modeling
   - Comprehensive performance metrics (`backtest/metrics.py`)

4. **Fixed CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Added pytest-asyncio to requirements.txt
   - Fixed datetime deprecation warnings
   - Updated test functions to return None
   - All 31 tests now passing

5. **GitHub Issue Management**
   - Closed 3 completed issues (#12, #14, #16)
   - Created new labels (partially-complete, phase-1/2/3-complete)
   - Organized remaining issues by phase

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Push commits to GitHub to verify CI passes
2. **Phase 4 Options**:
   - Implement walk-forward optimization (`backtest/optimization.py`)
   - Add EdgeCalculator for EV/risk-reward analysis (Issue #18)
   - Implement risk-based position sizing (Issue #20)
3. **Production Readiness**:
   - Live trading integration with IBKR
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard
   - Performance reporting

## Blockers
None currently. System is operational with all phases integrated.

## Session Notes
- Session duration: ~1.5 hours
- Completed Phase 3 implementation from scratch
- Fixed all test failures and CI issues
- System now has complete trading capabilities: risk management (Phase 1) + data pipeline (Phase 2) + strategies (Phase 3)
- Ready for paper trading validation

## Key Files Modified
- Added: `robo_trader/strategies/` (4 files)
- Added: `robo_trader/backtest/` (3 files)
- Added: `test_phase3.py`
- Modified: `requirements.txt` (added scipy, pytest-asyncio)
- Modified: `robo_trader/logger.py` (datetime.utc fix)

## Test Status
```
Phase 1: 6/6 passing ✅
Phase 2: 6/6 passing ✅
Phase 3: 7/7 passing ✅
Integration: 12/12 passing ✅
Total: 31/31 tests passing
```

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
