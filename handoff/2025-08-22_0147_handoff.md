# Trading System Handoff - August 22, 2025, 01:47 AM PST

## Session Summary
This session focused on fixing dashboard chart display issues and improving the company events filtering functionality.

## Current System Status

### ðŸŸ¢ Running Processes
- **Dashboard**: Running at http://localhost:5555 (PID: 26158)
- **AI Trading System**: Running (PID: 26358)
- **Status**: Both systems operational, market closed (after hours)

### Recent Activity
- Company events successfully loading (8 events visible: VRT 8-K, WULF filings, multiple Form 4s)
- News feed operational with sentiment analysis
- Database persistence layer added for chart data
- Market closed - no live price updates

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Company Events Filtering âœ…
- Added filter buttons (All, SEC, 8-K, 10-Q/K, Form 4, Earnings, FDA)
- Implemented JavaScript filtering logic
- Fixed event type matching for proper filtering
- Styled filter buttons with active states

### 2. Increased Event Display âœ…
- Modified ai_runner.py to send ALL events to dashboard (not just high-impact)
- Lowered AI analysis threshold from 70 to 50
- Successfully increased visible events from 2 to 8

### 3. Chart Display Fixes âœ…
- **P&L Chart**: Fixed to show full trading day (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
  - Pre-generates 390-minute grid on initialization
  - Fixed x-axis to always show time labels
  - Fixed y-axis with minimum range to prevent zooming
  - Data placed at correct time positions based on actual time
  
- **Price Chart**: Fixed to match P&L chart behavior
  - Shows full trading day grid even when empty
  - Consistent time labeling with P&L chart
  - Ready for market hours data

### 4. Database Persistence Layer âœ…
- Added `price_history` table to SQLite database
- Created API endpoints for saving/loading chart data
- Implemented methods for retrieving last trading day data
- Simplified to avoid saving every price point (memory-only during trading)

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. **app.py**
   - Added company event filtering UI and logic
   - Fixed chart initialization with full-day labels
   - Added database endpoints for price/P&L history
   - Fixed chart update functions for proper time positioning

2. **robo_trader/ai_runner.py**
   - Sends all company events to dashboard
   - Lowered impact threshold for AI analysis

3. **robo_trader/database.py**
   - Added price_history table
   - Added methods for saving/loading price and P&L data

4. **robo_trader/company_intelligence.py**
   - Reviewed but not modified (working correctly)

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Current Issues
- Charts show empty during after-hours (expected - no live data)
- Need to test charts during market hours with real data
- Database persistence simplified but may need end-of-day snapshots

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Test During Market Hours**: Verify charts populate correctly with live data
2. **Add Historical Data Loading**: Load previous day's data when market closed
3. **Options Flow Analysis**: Implement the options flow monitoring
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for AI decision accuracy
5. **Risk Management**: Review and test risk limits before live trading

## Configuration Notes
- Market hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST (6:30 AM - 1:00 PM PST)
- Chart resolution: 1-minute intervals (390 points per day)
- Event filtering: Client-side JavaScript
- Database: SQLite with price_history, pnl_history tables

## Commands to Remember
```bash
# Restart both systems
./restart_trading.sh

# Check logs
tail -f dashboard.log
tail -f ai_trading.log

# Stop systems
pkill -f 'python.*app.py' && pkill -f 'python.*start_ai_trading'

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:5555
```

## Session Notes
- User wanted filtering for company events - implemented successfully
- P&L chart zooming issue was due to not pre-populating the full day grid
- Simplified data persistence after user feedback - only save important snapshots
- Charts now maintain fixed scale throughout the trading day
- System ready for market open testing
