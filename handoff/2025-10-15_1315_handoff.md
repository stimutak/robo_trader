## Session Summary
**Duration:** ~4 hours  
**Focus:** Diagnosing and fixing IBKR Gateway connection timeout issues  
**Status:** Root cause identified, solution planned

## Critical Discovery: ib_async Library Incompatibility

### The Problem
Gateway API handshake consistently times out after TCP connection succeeds, but ONLY when running in the trading system's async environment. Simple standalone scripts work perfectly.

### Root Cause Identified
**ib_async library has a fundamental incompatibility with complex async environments.**

**Evidence:**
1. ✅ **Simple standalone test works** - Connects in <1 second, gets accounts, disconnects cleanly
2. ❌ **Trading system fails** - TCP connects, then API handshake times out after 15-30 seconds
3. ✅ **Gateway is working correctly** - Logs show successful API connections from simple tests
4. ❌ **Not a configuration issue** - Same parameters work in simple test, fail in trading system
5. ❌ **Not zombie connections** - Cleanup works, zombies cleared before each attempt
6. ❌ **Not SSL/timeout/port issues** - All parameters verified correct

**Pattern:**
```
Simple Test (WORKS):
- python3 test_connection_minimal.py
- Connects instantly
- Gets accounts: ['DUN264991']
- Disconnects cleanly
- No zombies created

Trading System (FAILS):
- python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL
- TCP connects: "Connected"
- Waits 15-30 seconds
- Times out: "API connection failed: TimeoutError()"
- Creates zombie CLOSE_WAIT connections
```

### What We Tried (All Failed)
1. ❌ Increased timeout from 10s → 30s → 15s
2. ❌ Added delay before connection (0.1s)
3. ❌ Disabled SSL mode (plain TCP only)
4. ❌ Increased retry delays (5s base, 120s max)
5. ❌ Enhanced zombie cleanup logic
6. ❌ Multiple Gateway restarts
7. ❌ Different client IDs (1, 25, 52, 74, 84)
8. ❌ Verified Gateway configuration
9. ❌ Checked for VPN interference (Tailscale/ProtonVPN)

**None of these fixed the core issue because the problem is in the ib_async library itself.**

## Solution: Subprocess-Based IBKR Wrapper

### Why Subprocess Isolation?
The ib_async library works fine in simple async contexts but fails in complex async environments with:
- Multiple concurrent tasks
- Event loop complexity
- Nested async operations
- Long-running async processes

**Subprocess isolation completely separates the IBKR connection from our async environment.**

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Create Subprocess Wrapper
**File:** `robo_trader/clients/subprocess_ibkr_client.py`

**Features:**
- Runs ib_async in a separate Python subprocess
- Clean, isolated event loop
- JSON-based IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
- Handles connection, data requests, disconnection
- Automatic cleanup on failure

**Interface:**
```python
class SubprocessIBKRClient:
    async def connect(host, port, client_id, readonly, timeout) -> bool
    async def get_accounts() -> list[str]
    async def get_positions() -> list[Position]
    async def get_account_summary() -> dict
    async def disconnect() -> None
```

#### Phase 2: Update Robust Connection
**File:** `robo_trader/utils/robust_connection.py`

**Changes:**
- Replace direct ib_async calls with subprocess client
- Keep retry logic, circuit breaker, zombie cleanup
- Add subprocess health monitoring
- Handle subprocess crashes gracefully

#### Phase 3: Testing
1. Test subprocess client standalone
2. Test with trading system
3. Verify no zombie connections
4. Confirm stable long-running connections
5. Test reconnection after failures

## Changes Made This Session

### Code Changes
1. **Enhanced zombie cleanup** - Structured lsof output parsing
2. **Added SSL mode config** - `IBKR_SSL_MODE` (auto/require/disabled)
3. **Configurable timeout** - `IBKR_TIMEOUT` environment variable
4. **Connection delay** - 0.1s delay before connection attempts
5. **Better diagnostics** - Improved error logging and connection tracking
6. **Gateway process protection** - Never kill Gateway/TWS (manual restart only)

### Test Scripts Created
- `test_connection_minimal.py` - Minimal working connection test
- `test_exact_params.py` - Test with exact robust connection parameters
- `test_robust_logic.py` - Test robust connection logic
- `test_gateway_*.py` - Various Gateway connection tests

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with connection issue notes
- Updated `.env.example` with new SSL_MODE config
- Updated `README.md` with troubleshooting notes

## Current State

### What's Working
✅ Gateway is running and healthy  
✅ Simple connection tests work perfectly  
✅ Zombie cleanup logic works  
✅ Configuration is correct  
✅ Port 4002 is accessible  

### What's Broken
❌ Trading system cannot connect to Gateway  
❌ API handshake times out in complex async environment  
❌ System has been unable to trade for ~1 month  

### Next Steps
1. **Create subprocess-based IBKR wrapper** (Priority 1)
2. **Test subprocess wrapper standalone**
3. **Integrate with robust_connection.py**
4. **Test with full trading system**
5. **Monitor for stability over 24+ hours**

## Branch Status
- **Current branch:** `main`
- **Commit:** `2153c8a` - "fix: improve IBKR connection diagnostics and zombie cleanup"
- **Next branch:** `fix/subprocess-ibkr-wrapper` (to be created)

## Important Notes

### Gateway Management
- **NEVER kill Gateway processes** - Requires manual login with 2FA
- **Zombie connections owned by Gateway** - Can only be fixed by Gateway restart
- **Gateway restart clears state** - But zombies may persist at OS level
- **Use safe zombie kill:** `lsof -ti tcp:4002 -sTCP:CLOSE_WAIT | xargs kill -9`

### Connection Pattern
```
First connection after Gateway restart:
✅ Works (simple test)
❌ Fails (trading system)

Subsequent connections:
❌ All fail (Gateway becomes unresponsive due to zombies)

After Gateway restart:
✅ Pattern repeats
```

### Key Insight
**The issue is NOT Gateway - it's the ib_async library's behavior in complex async environments.**

This explains why:
- Simple tests always work
- Trading system always fails
- Gateway logs show successful connections from simple tests
- No widespread reports of this issue (most users don't run complex async systems)

## Files Modified
- `.env` - Added `IBKR_TIMEOUT=15.0`, `IBKR_SSL_MODE=disabled`
- `.env.example` - Added SSL_MODE documentation
- `robo_trader/config.py` - Added SSL mode config
- `robo_trader/utils/robust_connection.py` - Enhanced zombie cleanup, added delay
- `robo_trader/utils/tws_health.py` - Improved health checks
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added connection issue documentation
- `README.md` - Added troubleshooting notes

## Environment
- **OS:** macOS
- **Python:** 3.10+ (via `.venv`)
- **ib_async:** 2.0.1
- **Gateway:** IB Gateway (Paper Trading, Port 4002)
- **Account:** DUN264991

## Blockers
None - Solution path is clear, just needs implementation.

## Handoff to Next Session
1. Review this handoff document
2. Create branch `fix/subprocess-ibkr-wrapper`
3. Implement subprocess-based IBKR client
4. Test thoroughly before integrating
5. Monitor for 24+ hours after deployment
