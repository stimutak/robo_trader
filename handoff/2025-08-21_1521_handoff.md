# Session Handoff - August 21, 2025 15:21

## Session Summary
Fixed critical issue where system was only monitoring 5 symbols instead of full 21-symbol watchlist. System now properly tracking all portfolio positions.

## Current System Status
✅ **RUNNING** - AI Trading System Active
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5555
- Mode: Paper Trading
- Account: DUN080889
- All 21 symbols being monitored

## Changes Made This Session

### Critical Fixes
1. **News Fetching Expanded** (robo_trader/news.py:220)
   - Was: `for symbol in self.symbols[:5]`  
   - Now: `for symbol in self.symbols`
   - Impact: Now fetching RSS feeds for ALL 21 symbols

2. **Dashboard Symbol Display** (app.py:353)
   - Changed from `<input>` to `<textarea>` for better visibility
   - Shows all 21 symbols properly
   - Added height and font-size styling

3. **Default Symbol List** (app.py:52-54)
   - Updated fallback to use full 21-symbol list
   - Ensures proper defaults even if settings file missing

### New Features Added
- **options_flow.py**: Unusual options activity scanner
- **restart_trading.sh**: Clean restart script
- **news_bridge.py**: Dashboard-AI communication bridge
- **HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md**: Comprehensive status document

## Active Processes
```bash
PID 59247 - python app.py (Dashboard)
PID 59248 - python start_ai_trading.py (AI Trading)
```

## Symbol Watchlist (21 Total)
```
AAPL, NVDA, TSLA    # Major tech
IXHL, NUAI, BZAI    # AI/Biotech plays  
ELTP, OPEN          # Pharma/Real estate
ADA, HBAR           # Crypto (IB errors - not stocks)
CEG, VRT, PLTR      # Energy/Tech

## Current Activity
- Analyzing Walmart profit miss news (75% relevance)
- No trades executed yet (75% conviction threshold)
- News updating every 5 minutes
- Options flow scanning active

## Known Issues
1. **ADA/HBAR Errors**: These are crypto tokens, IB doesn't recognize as stocks
2. **Limited News Coverage**: Need company-specific sources (SEC, earnings)
3. **Basic UI**: Dashboard needs modern dark theme

## Next Priority Tasks

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Add Company-Specific Intelligence**
   - SEC EDGAR API for 8-K filings
   - Earnings calendar integration
   - FDA approval calendar (for IXHL, ELTP)
   - Insider trading alerts (Form 4)

2. **Modern Dashboard UI**
   - Cursor-style dark theme
   - Real-time price charts
   - Better data visualization
   - AI conviction gauge

3. **Social Sentiment**
   - Reddit r/wallstreetbets monitoring
   - StockTwits integration
   - Twitter/X mention tracking

## Configuration Files
- **user_settings.json**: Contains all 21 symbols, risk settings
- **.env**: API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, IB settings)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project philosophy and guidelines

## Testing Status
- ✅ All 21 symbols fetching news
- ✅ Dashboard displays correctly
- ✅ AI analyzing high-impact events
- ✅ Options flow scanner working
- ⏳ Waiting for high-conviction signals to trade

## Performance Metrics
- News articles: 70 loaded
- AI analyses: Active on high-impact news
- Trades executed: 0 (being selective - good!)
- System uptime: Stable

## How to Resume
```bash
# If system stopped:
./restart_trading.sh

# Check status:
curl http://localhost:5555/api/status | jq

# View logs:
tail -f logs from console output
```

## Session Notes
- Fixed major bug limiting symbol coverage
- System now comprehensively monitoring portfolio
- Ready for company-specific news integration
- Dashboard functional but needs UI polish
