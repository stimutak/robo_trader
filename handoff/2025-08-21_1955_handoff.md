## Data Philosophy Change
**Old**: Test data for visualization development
**New**: Real data only - no fake/misleading information
- After hours: Show "No activity" or previous day's data
- During market: Show actual live data as it comes in
- Empty charts are better than fake data

## Files Modified
1. `/robo_trader/options_flow.py` - Complete options flow analyzer
2. `/robo_trader/ai_runner.py` - Added options push to dashboard, news URLs
3. `/app.py` - Added visualizations, removed test data
4. `/restart_trading.sh` - Improved with nohup and logging

## How It Works

### During Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
1. News aggregator fetches RSS feeds every 5 minutes
2. Options flow scanner detects unusual activity
3. Claude AI analyzes high-impact events
4. Dashboard displays all signals in real-time
5. Trading decisions executed through IB API

### After Hours
- News continues updating (24/7 sources)
- Options flow shows "No unusual activity" 
- Charts show last known data or empty
- AI continues analyzing news for next day prep

## Verification
```bash
# Check system status
curl -s http://localhost:5555/api/status | jq

# View logs
tail -f dashboard.log
tail -f ai_trading.log

# Test options flow (market hours only)
python -m robo_trader.options_flow
```

## Next Priorities
1. **Historical Data Storage**
   - Save options flow signals to database
   - Store P&L history for multi-day charts
   - Cache news with timestamps

2. **Market Regime Detection**
   - Volatility classifier
   - Risk-on/off detection
   - Adaptive strategy selection

3. **Performance Analytics**
   - Win rate tracking
   - Sharpe ratio calculation
   - Trade journal with AI reasoning

## Known Limitations
- Options data only available during market hours
- Some symbols (ADA, HBAR) not tradeable on IB
- News URLs may not always be available from RSS feeds

## Dashboard Features
- **Start/Stop Trading**: One-click control
- **Symbol Management**: Edit watchlist in settings
- **Risk Controls**: Adjustable risk level and loss limits
- **Real-Time Updates**: All data refreshes every 2 seconds
- **Clean Logs**: Filtered IB warnings for readability

## Success Metrics
- Target: 2-5% monthly returns
- Max drawdown: <15%
- Win rate: 45-55% (focus on risk/reward)
- Sharpe ratio: >1.5

## Remember
**Philosophy**: Intelligence over speed - one smart trade beats 1000 dumb ones
**Safety**: Paper trading by default, strict risk limits
**Data**: Real information only, no fake/test data
