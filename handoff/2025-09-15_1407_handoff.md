## Session Summary
Fixed critical issues with the trading system that had been stuck in a zombie state since August 28, 2025. Restored full functionality and added new symbols to watchlist.

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Zombie Processes (18 Days Stuck)
- **Problem**: Trading system received SIGTERM on Aug 28 but never completed shutdown
- **Impact**: No trades executed, no logs written for 18 days
- **Solution**: Killed zombie processes (PIDs: 83370, 88447, 62255) and restarted system

### 2. False "Trading Active" Status
- **Problem**: Dashboard hardcoded IBKR connection as `True` on line 2424 of app.py
- **Impact**: System reported "Trading Active" even when IBKR wasn't connected
- **Solution**: Added `check_ibkr_connection()` function to verify actual connection status

### 3. No Logs in Dashboard
- **Problem**: Dashboard reading from empty in-memory list instead of log file
- **Impact**: No trading activity visible in dashboard logs section
- **Solution**: Modified `/api/logs` endpoint to read from `robo_trader.log` file

### 4. Logging Not Writing to File
- **Problem**: Missing `LOG_FILE` environment variable
- **Impact**: Logs only going to stdout, not persisted to file
- **Solution**: Set `LOG_FILE=/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader.log` when starting runner

## Current System Status

### Running Processes
1. **WebSocket Server**: Port 8765 - Broadcasting market data
2. **Trading Runner**: Processing 24 symbols with IBKR connection
3. **Dashboard**: Port 5555 - Monitoring interface with real logs
4. **IBKR Connection**: Port 7497 (Paper Trading) - 5 connections in pool

### Active Symbols (24 total)
- Original: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, IXHL, NUAI, BZAI, ELTP, OPEN, CEG, VRT, PLTR, UPST, TEM, HTFL, SDGR, APLD, SOFI, CORZ, WULF
- New (added): QQQ, QLD, BBIO, IMRX, CRGY
- Invalid (rejected by IBKR): PRTG, PTRGX

### System Health
- ✅ IBKR Connected and receiving market data
- ✅ ML models loaded (26 models active)
- ✅ Feature pipeline running
- ✅ Stop-loss monitor active (2% threshold)
- ✅ Logs writing to file and displaying in dashboard
- ✅ WebSocket broadcasting price updates

## Files Modified

### `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/app.py`
- Added `check_ibkr_connection()` function (lines 2415-2434)
- Modified `/api/status` endpoint to use real connection check
- Updated `/api/logs` endpoint to read from log file (lines 4247-4285)

## Commands to Restart System

```bash
# 1. Start WebSocket server
python3 -m robo_trader.websocket_server &

# 2. Start trading runner with logging
export LOG_FILE=/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader.log
python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF,QQQ,QLD,BBIO,IMRX,CRGY &

# 3. Start dashboard
export DASH_PORT=5555
python3 app.py &
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Trading Activity**: Check if trades are now being executed with the system properly running
2. **Validate PRTG/PTRGX**: Verify if these are correct ticker symbols or need alternatives
3. **Database Check**: Verify trades are being saved to SQLite database (currently empty)
4. **Performance Review**: System was stuck for 18 days - review why no trades since Jan 9

## Important Notes

- The system had been in a "zombie mode" since Aug 28 - running but non-functional
- No trades have been executed since January 9th according to database
- Kill switch is NOT active (no `data/kill_switch.lock` file)
- System is in paper trading mode with IBKR TWS

## Session Duration
Start: Investigation of fake "trading active" status
End: System fully restored with new symbols and working logs
Key Achievement: Recovered from 18-day zombie state and restored full functionality
