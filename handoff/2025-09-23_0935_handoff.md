## Session Summary
**Session Focus:** TWS API Connection Troubleshooting & Migration to ib_async

**Key Accomplishment:** Successfully migrated entire codebase from unmaintained `ib_insync` to actively maintained `ib_async` library.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Library Migration (100% Complete)**
   - Uninstalled `ib_insync` v0.9.86 (unmaintained since March 2024)
   - Installed `ib_async` v2.0.1 (actively maintained successor)
   - Updated all Python files to use new library:
     - Core: `async_ibkr_client.py`, `smart_executor.py`, `app.py`
     - Tests: 18 test files updated
     - All imports changed from `ib_insync` → `ib_async`

2. **Root Cause Identified**
   - TWS API connection issue NOT related to library choice
   - TWS accepts TCP connections on port 7497 but fails API handshake
   - `apiStart` event never fires, causing timeout after 20-60 seconds
   - Issue confirmed with both libraries - problem is TWS configuration

### ❌ Blocked Issues
1. **TWS API Connection Failure**
   - TWS version: 10.39 (running on macOS)
   - Port 7497 is open and listening (IPv6)
   - Socket connects successfully
   - API handshake fails - TWS not responding to protocol
   - Not caused by Malwarebytes (tested with all protection disabled)

## Running Processes
```bash
# Currently running:
- WebSocket server: PID 2486 (running since Friday)
- Dashboard: PID 2898 (port 5555)
- TWS: PID 9922 (started 8:46 AM)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix TWS API Configuration**
   - In TWS: File → Global Configuration → API → Settings
   - Ensure "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" is checked ✅
   - Set "Master API client ID" to **0** (important: not blank, specifically 0)
   - Uncheck "Read-Only API" if checked
   - Add 127.0.0.1 to Trusted IP addresses
   - Look for any pending connection approval dialogs

2. **Alternative: Try IB Gateway Instead**
   - IB Gateway often more stable for API connections
   - Download from Interactive Brokers website
   - Use port 4001 (paper) or 4002 (live)

3. **Once TWS/Gateway Fixed**
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   python3 test_retry_connection.py

   # Start trading system
   pkill -9 -f "runner_async"
   export LOG_FILE=/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader.log
   python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF,QQQ,QLD,BBIO,IMRX,CRGY &
   ```

## Technical Details

### Migration Changes Made
- Package change: `ib_insync` → `ib_async`
- No API changes required (drop-in replacement)
- All functionality preserved
- Better maintenance and support going forward

### Connection Debugging Performed
1. Tested multiple client IDs (0, 31, 83, 125, 192, 555, 777, 888, 900-905, 999)
2. Tested IPv4 (127.0.0.1) and IPv6 (::1) connections
3. Tested multiple ports (7497, 7496, 4001, 4002)
4. Verified with raw socket connections
5. Disabled Malwarebytes protection (no effect)
6. Increased timeouts to 60 seconds (still fails)

### Error Pattern
```
Connected (TCP socket established)
→ Waiting for apiStart event
→ TimeoutError after 20-60 seconds
→ TWS never sends API protocol response
```

## Session Notes

### Key Discoveries
1. `ib_insync` author Ewald de Wit passed away early 2024
2. Library archived March 2024, no longer maintained
3. `ib_async` is official successor by original development team
4. TWS 10.39 may have API issues - consider downgrading if problems persist

### Files Modified
- `/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py`
- `/robo_trader/smart_execution/smart_executor.py`
- `/app.py`
- 18 test files in `/tests/` and root directory
- Multiple debug/test scripts created

### Dependencies Updated
```
Removed: ib-insync==0.9.86
Added: ib_async==2.0.1, aeventkit==2.1.0
```
