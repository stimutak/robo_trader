## Session Summary
Successfully fixed critical IBKR connection issue that prevented trading since September 15, 2025 (3-day outage).

## Critical Fix Implemented

### Root Cause
- ib_insync's `connectAsync()` method was completely broken, timing out 100% of the time
- System was trying to use async connection in an already running event loop

### Solution Applied
1. **Fixed async_ibkr_client.py:**
   - Added `from ib_insync.util import patchAsyncio`
   - Enabled nested event loops with `patchAsyncio()`
   - Changed from broken `connectAsync()` to working sync `connect()`
   - Removed invalid timeout parameter from connection call

2. **Fixed runner_async.py:**
   - Updated client ID range from (1,10) to (10,99) based on testing
   - Fixed max_connections from 5 to 1 (TWS only supports one connection per client ID)

## Current System Status

### ✅ Running Processes
1. **WebSocket Server**: Running on port 8765
2. **Trading Runner**: Connected with 22 watchlist symbols
   - Symbols: AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, IXHL, NUAI, BZAI, ELTP, OPEN, CEG, VRT, PLTR, UPST, TEM, HTFL, SDGR, APLD, SOFI, CORZ, WULF, QQQ, SPY, MSFT
   - Status: Waiting for market open (8.8 hours)
   - IBKR Connection: Working properly
3. **Dashboard**: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5555

### System Health
- IBKR API connection: ✅ Working (fixed after 3-day outage)
- WebSocket connectivity: ✅ Connected
- Market status: Closed (opens in ~8.8 hours)
- Trading mode: Paper

## Files Modified
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/clients/async_ibkr_client.py` - Fixed async connection issue
- `/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader/runner_async.py` - Updated client ID range and max connections

## Testing Performed
- Direct synchronous connection test: ✅ Successful
- Async connection with patchAsyncio: ✅ Successful
- Client ID range 10-99: ✅ Working
- Full system startup: ✅ Complete

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor Market Open**: System should automatically start trading when market opens
2. **Verify Trading**: Check that trades execute properly during market hours
3. **Monitor Dashboard**: Verify real-time updates are working at http://127.0.0.1:5555

## Known Issues
- None currently - system is operational

## Commands to Restart System (if needed)
```bash
# Kill all processes
pkill -9 -f "runner_async" && pkill -9 -f "app.py" && pkill -9 -f "websocket_server"

# Start fresh
python3 -m robo_trader.websocket_server &
export LOG_FILE=/Users/oliver/robo_trader/robo_trader.log
python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF,QQQ,SPY,MSFT &
export DASH_PORT=5555 && python3 app.py &
```

## Session Notes
- User was extremely frustrated after 3 days of system downtime
- Initial attempts to fix with asyncio.wait_for and run_in_executor were wrong
- Key insight: ib_insync's official patchAsyncio() solution for nested event loops
- System now fully operational and waiting for market open
