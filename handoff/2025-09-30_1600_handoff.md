# Handoff Document - 2025-09-30 16:00

## Session Summary
**ZOMBIE FIX VERIFIED WORKING** ✅ - But discovered separate TWS API handshake issue preventing connections.

## Current Status

### ✅ Zombie Connection Fix - WORKING
The fix from commit 5c791fa IS functioning correctly:
- **Before fix**: 6 zombie connections in CLOSE_WAIT state
- **After fix**: 0-1 zombies (normal cleanup state)
- Cleanup code is executing: Logs show "Disconnecting" after each failed attempt
- `netstat` confirms only 1 connection in CLOSED state (normal)

### ❌ TWS API Handshake Issue - BLOCKING
**Problem**: TWS is NOT completing API handshake even with "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" checkbox ENABLED.

**Symptoms**:
1. TCP connection succeeds (socket connects to port 7497)
2. TWS accepts the socket connection
3. API handshake times out after 10 seconds
4. TWS logs show NO API connection attempts logged
5. Even simple test scripts fail with `TimeoutError()`

**Evidence**:
```bash
# netstat shows only LISTEN and one CLOSED connection
tcp46      0      0  *.7497                 *.*                    LISTEN
tcp4       0      0  [::127.0.0.1]:7497->[::127.0.0.1]:64771 (CLOSED)

# lsof shows TWS (JavaAppli PID 4748) has listening socket
JavaAppli 4748 oliver   46u  IPv6 ... TCP *:7497 (LISTEN)

# BUT diagnostic shows API handshake timeout
✅ Port 7497 is OPEN
❌ API HANDSHAKE TIMEOUT
```

**TWS Configuration Checked**:
- ✅ "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients" IS checked
- ✅ Port 7497 configured
- ✅ Client ID 0 configured as Master API
- ✅ 127.0.0.1 in trusted IPs

**TWS Logs**:
- No API connection attempts logged at all
- Only market data connection logs from 11:47 AM
- Suggests TWS API listener is not actually processing connections despite checkbox

## Investigation Timeline

### Initial Problem (Continuation from 2025-09-30_1445)
- System was using robust_connection module
- Getting connection timeouts
- User reported: "dash says realtime trading started, trading started them changed to trading stopped"

### Discovery Process
1. **First check**: Found 6 zombie connections from before fix
2. **Second check**: After retry attempts, down to 1 zombie - **cleanup IS working!**
3. **Key insight**: Even simple test_direct_connection.py times out
4. **Diagnosis**: Created diagnose_tws.py which confirmed:
   - TCP layer works (port is open)
   - API layer fails (handshake timeout)
   - TWS not logging any API attempts

### What This Is NOT
- ❌ NOT a zombie connection problem (fixed and verified)
- ❌ NOT a code problem (test scripts also fail)
- ❌ NOT a port problem (port 7497 is listening)
- ❌ NOT a checkbox problem (checkbox IS enabled)

### What This IS
- ✅ TWS API listener not responding to handshake requests
- ✅ Socket accepted but no API protocol exchange
- ✅ Possibly TWS internal state issue

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. TWS Internal State Corruption
**Symptoms match**: Socket connects but API doesn't respond
**Solution**: Full machine restart (not just TWS restart)
- TWS may have internal state that persists through restarts
- macOS kernel may have stale socket state
- Java VM may have cached state

### 2. Conflicting Software
**Possible conflicts**:
- Other trading software using port 7497
- Security software blocking API handshake
- Firewall rules blocking localhost connections
- Anti-virus interfering with Java processes

**Check**:
```bash
# Check for other software on port 7497
lsof -i :7497

# Check firewall rules
/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
```

### 3. TWS API Module Not Loading
**Symptoms match**: Checkbox enabled but API not functional
**Possible cause**: TWS API module failed to load during startup
**Solution**:
1. Fully quit TWS (not just close window)
2. Check for TWS background processes: `ps aux | grep -i tws`
3. Force kill if needed: `kill -9 <PID>`
4. Restart TWS
5. Re-enable API checkbox

### 4. ib_async Library Issue
**Unlikely but possible**: Protocol mismatch between ib_async 2.0.1 and TWS version
**Check TWS version**: File → About Trader Workstation
**Solution**: Verify TWS API version compatibility

## Files Changed This Session
- `diagnose_tws.py` - NEW: Diagnostic tool for TWS connection issues
- No code changes (zombie fix already committed in previous session)

## Testing Performed
1. ✅ Verified robust_connection is being used (log messages confirm)
2. ✅ Verified zombie cleanup is working (netstat shows only 1 CLOSED)
3. ✅ Tested direct connection (fails with same timeout)
4. ✅ Checked TWS configuration (API enabled, correct settings)
5. ✅ Verified port is open (TCP connection succeeds)
6. ❌ API handshake fails in all scenarios

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Full Machine Restart (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# 1. Save all work and close all applications
# 2. Restart Mac
# 3. Start TWS first, let it fully load
# 4. Verify API checkbox: File → Global Configuration → API → Settings
# 5. Start trading system
cd /Users/oliver/robo_trader
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m robo_trader.websocket_server &
python3 -m robo_trader.runner_async --symbols AAPL,NVDA,TSLA,IXHL,NUAI,BZAI,ELTP,OPEN,CEG,VRT,PLTR,UPST,TEM,HTFL,SDGR,APLD,SOFI,CORZ,WULF,QQQ,QLD,BBIO,IMRX,CRGY &
export DASH_PORT=5555 && python3 app.py &
```

### Option 2: Force TWS Restart
```bash
# 1. Kill all TWS processes
ps aux | grep -i tws | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9

# 2. Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# 3. Restart TWS from Applications
# 4. Re-enable API and test
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 diagnose_tws.py
```

### Option 3: Check for Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's using port 7497
lsof -i :7497

# Check for firewall issues
/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate

# Check for other Java processes
ps aux | grep java
```

## System State

### Running Processes (25+ duplicate background processes)
**CRITICAL**: Many duplicate runners/websocket servers/dashboard processes running
These should be killed before next test:
```bash
pkill -9 -f "runner_async"
pkill -9 -f "app.py"
pkill -9 -f "websocket_server"
```

### Current Branch
- Branch: main
- Latest commit: 5c791fa (zombie connection fix)
- Working directory: Clean (except new diagnose_tws.py)

### TWS Status
- Process: Running (PID 4748)
- Port: 7497 listening
- API checkbox: Enabled
- API handshake: **NOT RESPONDING**

## Key Learnings

### The Zombie Fix Works
The fix added in commit 5c791fa successfully prevents zombie connection accumulation:
```python
except Exception as e:
    # CRITICAL: Clean up failed connection to prevent zombie sockets
    try:
        if ib.isConnected():
            ib.disconnect()
    except Exception as cleanup_err:
        logger.warning(f"Error disconnecting failed IB connection: {cleanup_err}")
    raise
```

This cleanup executes on every failed connection attempt, preventing CLOSE_WAIT state accumulation.

### TWS API Handshake is Fragile
The TWS API can enter a state where:
- Port is open and accepting connections
- Socket layer works (connection succeeds)
- API layer doesn't respond (handshake timeout)
- No errors logged by TWS
- Checkbox settings appear correct

This suggests TWS API listener can become "stuck" in a non-functional state that requires more than just unchecking/rechecking the API checkbox.

## Technical Details

### Connection Flow (Current Behavior)
```
Client: Connect to 127.0.0.1:7497 → SUCCESS (TCP handshake)
TWS:    Accept socket connection → SUCCESS
Client: Send API handshake request → SENT
TWS:    Process API handshake → NO RESPONSE (TIMEOUT)
Client: Wait 10 seconds → TIMEOUT ERROR
Client: Call ib.disconnect() → CLEANUP (no zombie)
```

### What Should Happen
```
Client: Connect to 127.0.0.1:7497 → SUCCESS
TWS:    Accept socket connection → SUCCESS
TWS:    Log "API client connecting..." → MISSING
Client: Send API handshake → SENT
TWS:    Process handshake → MISSING
TWS:    Send handshake response → MISSING
Client: Receive response → MISSING
Client: Request account info → MISSING
TWS:    Send account list → MISSING
```

The handshake exchange is completely absent from TWS side.

## Session Notes
- Started with zombie connection concerns
- Discovered zombie fix IS working
- Identified separate TWS API handshake issue
- Created diagnostic tool (diagnose_tws.py)
- Verified all configuration settings correct
- Concluded TWS API listener is not functional despite appearing enabled

## Session End
**Status**: Zombie fix verified working, but TWS API handshake blocking all connections
**Branch**: main
**Latest Commit**: 5c791fa
**Next Action**: Recommend full machine restart to clear TWS/macOS state
