# Robo Trader Handoff Document
**Date:** 2025-08-26 13:37
**Session:** Docker CI Fix & System Testing

## Current Status
✅ **Completed:**
- Fixed Docker CI build failure (changed from multi-platform to single platform)
- Pushed fix to GitHub (commit cb1496d)
- Tested full system startup locally - both dashboard and trading system work
- Verified IB Gateway connection detection
- Confirmed dashboard accessible at http://localhost:5555

## CI Pipeline Status
⚠️ **Failing - Needs Attention:**

### 1. Import Sorting Issues (Lint Job)
- **Issue:** 34 files have incorrectly sorted imports per isort
- **Fix Required:** Run `isort robo_trader tests` locally and commit
- **Affected:** Most Python files across the codebase

### 2. Safety Action Version (Deploy Job)
- **Issue:** `pyupio/safety@v1` action not found
- **Fix Required:** Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to use `pyupio/safety@2.3.5` or remove if not needed

### 3. Missing Test Coverage (Test Job)
- **Issue:** pytest-cov not installed
- **Fix Required:** Add `pytest-cov` to requirements-dev.txt or remove `--cov` flags from test command

## Why CI Wasn't Fixed Now
The focus was on:
1. Fixing the critical Docker build blocker first (completed)
2. Verifying the system runs locally (completed)
3. The remaining CI issues are non-critical linting/testing issues that don't block functionality

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Fix CI):
```bash
# 1. Fix import sorting
source venv/bin/activate
isort robo_trader tests
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Sort imports to pass linting"

# 2. Fix safety action version
# Edit .github/workflows/deploy.yml line with pyupio/safety@v1
# Change to pyupio/safety@2.3.5

# 3. Fix pytest-cov
echo "pytest-cov>=4.0.0" >> requirements-dev.txt
pip install pytest-cov
git add requirements-dev.txt
git commit -m "fix: Add pytest-cov dependency"

git push
```

### After CI Fixed:
1. **Monitor Production** - Set up the launchd service for automated trading
2. **Performance Tuning** - Optimize AI analyst response times
3. **Add More Strategies** - Implement additional trading strategies
4. **Enhanced Dashboard** - Add more real-time metrics and controls

## Running the System

### Start Everything:
```bash
./start_all.sh
```

### Start Individual Components:
```bash
./start_trading.sh    # Trading system only
./start_dashboard.sh   # Dashboard only
```

### Stop Everything:
```bash
./stop_all.sh
```

### View Logs:
```bash
tail -f ai_trading.log
tail -f dashboard.log
```

## System Architecture Notes
- Trading system runs Phase 1-5 features including:
  - AI Analyst integration with GPT-4
  - Portfolio tracking with SQLite database
  - Risk management with position limits and caps
  - Strategy management with multiple strategies
  - Production monitoring and alerting
- Dashboard provides real-time monitoring at http://localhost:5555
- IB Gateway integration for live/paper trading

## Known Issues
- CI pipeline has linting and test failures (non-critical)
- Database temp files (trading_data.db-shm/wal) are auto-modified during runtime (expected behavior)

## Session Notes
- Fixed critical Docker buildx multi-platform issue
- System is fully functional locally
- CI fixes deferred to allow immediate system usage
