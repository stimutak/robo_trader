GitHub Issue Content Guard Hook

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
- Prevents GitHub issues created through Claude Code from containing "Claude" or "Anthropic" references
- Blocks both MCP GitHub tools (mcp__github__create_issue, etc.) and gh CLI commands
- Allows emojis in GitHub issues (unlike the commit guard hook)
- Provides helpful error messages and suggests cleaned commands when blocking

SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS:
1. For MCP GitHub tools: Scans title, body, comment, and content fields for prohibited terms
2. For gh CLI commands: Scans the entire command line for prohibited terms
3. Case-insensitive matching for "claude" and "anthropic"
4. Suggests cleaned versions of gh commands when possible
5. Exits with code 2 to block the operation when prohibited content is found

TRIGGERED BY:
- MCP tools: mcp__github__create_issue, mcp__github__add_issue_comment, mcp__github__update_issue
- Bash commands: gh issue create, gh issue edit, gh issue comment

This prevents issues like "Generated with Claude Code" from appearing in GitHub issues.
