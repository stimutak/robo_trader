    The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged as expected but signaled a more 
    dovish stance than anticipated. Chair Powell emphasized that the central bank is 
    prepared to cut rates if economic conditions warrant, citing concerns about global 
    growth and trade tensions. Markets rallied strongly on the news, with the S&P 500 
    surging to new highs. Analysts are now pricing in multiple rate cuts for next year,
    marking a significant shift from the hawkish tone of previous meetings. This pivot
    suggests the Fed is prioritizing economic stability over inflation concerns.
