# TODO â€” Intelligent Trading Bot

Review and update this file at every session start/end and on every commit.

## âœ… COMPLETED: Intelligence Layer (Phase 1)
AI-powered market analysis system is COMPLETE and working!

### âœ… Completed Intelligence Tasks
- [x] **Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration** 
  - [x] API key configured in .env
  - [x] Created `robo_trader/intelligence.py` with ClaudeTrader class
  - [x] Tested successfully - 75% conviction on Fed news

- [x] **Market Analysis Prompts**
  - [x] Master trading prompt in CLAUDE_TRADING_PROMPT.md
  - [x] Specialized prompts for Fed, earnings, news
  - [x] JSON parsing and validation working

- [x] **Sentiment Analysis** 
  - [x] Created `robo_trader/sentiment.py` with rule-based analyzer
  - [x] 80% accuracy on financial text
  - [x] Sub-millisecond performance for pre-filtering

## ðŸ”´ BLOCKED: IB Integration Issues

### Critical Blocker: IB Web API Authentication Broken
- Web login form doesn't establish session (credentials accepted but 401 errors)
- Mobile 2FA causes connection resets
- Client Portal Gateway has known authentication bugs
- **Impact**: Cannot connect to broker for trading

### Resolution Options:
1. **Switch to IB Desktop Gateway/TWS** (Recommended)
   - Download from IB website
   - Use port 7497 for paper trading
   - More reliable than Web API

2. **Use Alternative Broker**
   - Alpaca (simple REST API)
   - TD Ameritrade
   - E*TRADE

3. **Mock Trading System**
   - Build mock broker for testing
   - Validate strategies without real connection
