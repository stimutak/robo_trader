# Robo Trader Requirements & Architecture Document

## Project Overview
An intelligent automated trading system using Interactive Brokers API that makes real-time trading decisions based on market microstructure, news events, and technical analysis. The system should process events in microseconds and incorporate both traditional quantitative methods and modern AI/ML approaches.

**Implementation:**
```python
DataSources:
  - IB API: Price/volume/order book data
  - News APIs: Benzinga, AlphaVantage, Bloomberg Terminal API
  - Alternative data: Reddit API (PRAW), Twitter/X API
  - Economic data: FRED API, BLS data feeds
  
Storage:
  - TimescaleDB: Tick data (partitioned by day)
