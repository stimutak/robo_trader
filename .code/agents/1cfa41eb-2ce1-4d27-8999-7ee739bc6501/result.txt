### Phased Roadmap

#### Milestone 1: Foundational Enhancements & Developer Ergonomics

*   **Goals**: Improve developer experience, strengthen testing foundations, and enhance observability.
*   **Work Items**:
    *   **Quick Win**: Create a `seeded_test_data.py` script to generate deterministic datasets for tests.
    *   **Quick Win**: Implement a `pytest` fixture for isolated, in-memory SQLite database instances.
    *   Refactor `app.py` into a package with Blueprints for better organization (`dashboard/`, `api/`).
    *   Introduce structured logging (e.g., using `structlog`) across the application.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Verify that the new fixture provides a clean database for each test function.
    *   Ensure all API endpoints in the refactored dashboard work as expected.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   Reduced boilerplate in tests.
    *   Logs are queryable and provide clear context.

#### Milestone 2: Data Reliability & Idempotency

*   **Goals**: Ensure robust data handling and prevent data corruption.
*   **Work Items**:
    *   Implement idempotent write operations in `database_async.py` using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
    *   Define a clear schema for market data, signals, and trades with data validation.
    *   Establish a data retention and archival policy for the SQLite database.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Write tests to verify that duplicate data insertion is handled gracefully.
    *   Create a script to simulate database recovery from a backup.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   No data duplication or corruption under high load.
    *   Clear and enforceable data management policies.

#### Milestone 3: Advanced Risk Management

*   **Goals**: Implement sophisticated risk controls to protect capital.
*   **Work Items**:
    *   Integrate volatility-based position sizing (e.g., using ATR).
    *   Implement pre-trade checks for fat-finger errors and compliance with risk limits.
    *   Add controls for short selling, including borrow availability checks.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Develop a suite of tests to simulate various risk scenarios (e.g., flash crashes, fat-finger trades).
    *   Verify that the system halts trading when critical risk limits are breached.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   The system prevents trades that violate risk policies.
    *   Position sizes are dynamically adjusted based on market volatility.

#### Milestone 4: Strategy Lifecycle Management

*   **Goals**: Streamline the process of developing, testing, and deploying new strategies.
*   **Work Items**:
    *   Define a formal strategy interface with clear contracts for signals and metadata.
    *   Implement a shadow mode for new strategies to run without executing trades.
    *   Develop a framework for A/B testing different strategies in a live environment.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Create a sample strategy and test its lifecycle from shadow mode to live deployment.
    *   Verify that A/B testing metrics are accurately collected and reported.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   New strategies can be safely tested and deployed without manual intervention.
    *   Clear performance data is available to compare strategies.

#### Milestone 5: ML Pipeline Automation

*   **Goals**: Automate the ML model lifecycle from training to deployment.
*   **Work Items**:
    *   Implement a feature store to ensure consistency between training and inference.
    *   Automate model retraining and versioning using a model registry.
    *   Set up monitoring for model drift and data quality.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Write an end-to-end test for the ML pipeline, from feature generation to model deployment.
    *   Simulate data drift and verify that the monitoring system raises an alert.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   The ML pipeline is fully automated and requires minimal manual intervention.
    *   Model performance is continuously monitored and maintained.

#### Milestone 6: Production Hardening & CI/CD

*   **Goals**: Prepare the system for production deployment with a robust CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Work Items**:
    *   Create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/` that runs linting, typing, security checks, and tests.
    *   Implement a secure secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager).
    *   Develop a rollback plan and runbooks for handling production incidents.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Trigger the CI/CD pipeline and ensure all checks pass.
    *   Conduct a mock incident response drill to test the runbooks.
*   **Success Criteria**:
    *   All code is automatically tested and validated before deployment.
    *   The team is prepared to handle production incidents effectively.Here is a comprehensive, staged plan to evolve and operate the RoboTrader system.

### **Architecture and Ownership Map**

First, a conceptual map of the system's bounded contexts and the roles responsible for them. This informs the division of labor in the subsequent milestones.
