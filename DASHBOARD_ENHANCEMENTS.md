# Dashboard Enhancement Plan

## Current Dashboard Status
- ✅ Basic monitoring interface operational
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates working
- ✅ Shows positions, watchlist, P&L
- ✅ Performance metrics display
- ⚠️ Missing advanced features for production trading

## Dashboard Enhancement Tasks

### D1: Trade History & Execution Analytics (8h)
**Priority: HIGH**
- Add comprehensive trade history view
- Show all executed trades with timestamps
- Include entry/exit prices, P&L per trade
- Add filtering by date, symbol, strategy
- Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- Files: `app.py`, add `/api/trades` endpoint

### D2: Advanced Charting & Technical Analysis (12h)
**Priority: HIGH**
- Integrate TradingView or Lightweight Charts
- Real-time candlestick charts for each symbol
- Overlay technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD)
- Volume analysis and order flow
- Multi-timeframe views (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d)
- Files: `app.py`, `static/js/charts.js`

### D3: ML Model Performance Dashboard (10h)
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Real-time model predictions display
- Feature importance visualization
- Model accuracy metrics over time
- Confusion matrix for signals
- A/B testing results between models
- Files: `app.py`, `/api/ml/performance` endpoint

### D4: Risk Management Console (8h)
**Priority: HIGH**
- Real-time risk metrics display
- Portfolio beta, correlation matrix
- VaR and stress testing results
- Position size recommendations
- Risk limit monitoring with alerts
- Drawdown tracking and analysis
- Files: `app.py`, `/api/risk` endpoints

### D5: Strategy Control Panel (10h)
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- Enable/disable strategies in real-time
- Adjust strategy parameters via UI
- Strategy performance comparison
- Backtesting interface
- Parameter optimization visualization
- Files: `app.py`, `/api/strategy` endpoints

### D6: Order Management Interface (12h)
**Priority: LOW (for Phase 3)
- Manual order entry form
- Order book visualization
- Pending orders management
- Order modification/cancellation
- Execution reports
- Files: `app.py`, `/api/orders` endpoints

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1 Priority (This Week)
1. **D1: Trade History** - Essential for tracking system performance
2. **D4: Risk Management Console** - Critical for safe trading

### Phase 2 Priority (Next Week)
3. **D2: Advanced Charting** - Better market visualization
4. **D3: ML Performance** - Track model effectiveness

### Phase 3 Priority (Future)
5. **D5: Strategy Control** - Advanced control features
6. **D6: Order Management** - Manual intervention capability

## Technical Requirements

### Backend (app.py)
- New API endpoints for each feature
- Async database queries for performance
- WebSocket updates for real-time data
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Frontend
- Modern JavaScript framework integration (Vue.js or React)
- Responsive design for mobile access
- Dark/light theme support
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Database
- Add trades history table
- Add strategy_performance table
- Add risk_metrics table
- Optimize queries with proper indexing

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 1 second
- Real-time updates < 100ms latency
- Support 10+ concurrent users
- Mobile responsive design
- 99.9% uptime

## Current Dashboard Features to Preserve
- WebSocket real-time price updates
- Position management view
- Watchlist functionality
- P&L tracking
- Performance metrics display
- Market hours awareness

## Notes
- Dashboard is currently embedded in app.py as HTML_TEMPLATE
- Consider splitting into separate template files for maintainability
- Add user authentication for production deployment
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
