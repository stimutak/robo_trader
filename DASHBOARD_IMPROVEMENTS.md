# Dashboard Improvements - October 24, 2025

## Overview
This document describes the dashboard improvements made to enhance user experience and provide more accurate system status information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Log Display with Local Timestamps

**Problem:** 
- Logs displayed oldest entries first, requiring scrolling to see recent activity
- Timestamps showed in ISO format, not user-friendly local time

**Solution:**
- Reversed log order to show newest entries first
- Parse ISO timestamps and convert to local time (HH:MM:SS format)
- Improved timestamp parsing with fallback for edge cases

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` (lines 5018-5048): Updated `/api/logs` endpoint

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Parse ISO timestamp and convert to local time
from datetime import datetime
dt = datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
timestamp = dt.strftime("%H:%M:%S")

# Return logs in reverse order (newest first)
return jsonify({"logs": list(reversed(logs[-100:]))})
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Newest logs appear first when tab loads
- ✅ Timestamps show in readable local time (e.g., "22:46:04")
- ✅ No need to scroll to see recent activity

### 2. TWS/Gateway Connection Status Display

**Problem:**
- Dashboard only checked TWS (port 7497), not Gateway (port 4002)
- Status didn't distinguish between TWS and Gateway
- Users couldn't tell which IBKR platform was running

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `check_ibkr_connection()` to check both ports
- Added separate status fields for TWS and Gateway
- Improved status messages to show which platform is running

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` (lines 2956-3000): Updated `check_ibkr_connection()` function
- `app.py` (lines 3071-3113): Updated `/api/status` endpoint

**Code Changes:**
```python
def check_ibkr_connection():
    # Check TWS (port 7497)
    tws_healthy = check_port(7497)
    
    # Check Gateway (port 4002)
    gateway_healthy = check_port(4002)
    
    # Determine status message
    if tws_healthy and gateway_healthy:
        status_msg = "TWS (7497) and Gateway (4002) running"
    elif tws_healthy:
        status_msg = "TWS running (port 7497)"
    elif gateway_healthy:
        status_msg = "Gateway running (port 4002)"
    else:
        status_msg = "No TWS/Gateway detected"
    
    return {
        "connected": tws_healthy or gateway_healthy,
        "status": status_msg,
        "tws_running": tws_healthy,
        "gateway_running": gateway_healthy
    }
```

**API Response Changes:**
```json
{
  "trading_status": {
    "connected": true,
    "tws_health": "Gateway running (port 4002)",
    "tws_running": false,
    "gateway_running": true,
    "symbols_count": 19
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Dashboard shows which platform is running (TWS, Gateway, or both)
- ✅ Clear status messages for users
- ✅ Separate boolean flags for programmatic access

### 3. Symbol Count in Status

**Problem:**
- Dashboard didn't show how many symbols were being traded

**Solution:**
- Read symbol count from `user_settings.json`
- Add `symbols_count` field to status response

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` (lines 3077-3085): Added symbol count logic

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Get symbol count from user_settings.json
symbols_count = 0
try:
    with open("user_settings.json", "r") as f:
        settings = json.load(f)
        symbols = settings.get("default", {}).get("symbols", [])
        symbols_count = len(symbols)
except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError):
    symbols_count = 0
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Dashboard shows "19 symbols" in status
- ✅ Updates dynamically if user_settings.json changes

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed

**1. Log Display Test:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5555/api/logs | python3 -m json.tool | head -10
```
Result: ✅ Logs show newest first with local timestamps

**2. Status Display Test:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5555/api/status | python3 -m json.tool
```
Result: ✅ Shows Gateway running, TWS not running, 19 symbols

**3. Timestamp Parsing Test:**
```python
timestamp_str = '2025-10-24T23:05:16.714218'
dt = datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))
print(dt.strftime("%H:%M:%S"))  # Output: 23:05:16
```
Result: ✅ Timestamp parsing works correctly

**4. Connection Check Test:**
```python
# Check both ports
tws_healthy = check_port(7497)      # False
gateway_healthy = check_port(4002)  # True
status = "Gateway running (port 4002)"
```
Result: ✅ Correctly detects Gateway on port 4002

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Newest logs visible immediately (no scrolling)
   - Readable timestamps in local time
   - Clear indication of which IBKR platform is running

2. **Better System Visibility**
   - Know exactly which platform is connected
   - See how many symbols are being traded
   - Distinguish between TWS and Gateway

3. **Easier Troubleshooting**
   - Recent logs appear first for quick diagnosis
   - Clear status messages for connection issues
   - Separate flags for programmatic monitoring

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- ✅ Existing API endpoints unchanged (same URLs)
- ✅ New fields added to responses (no fields removed)
- ✅ Existing clients will continue to work
- ✅ New clients can use enhanced fields

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Add timezone display to timestamps
- Add filtering/search to log display
- Add historical connection status tracking
- Add alerts for connection state changes
- Add symbol-level status breakdown
